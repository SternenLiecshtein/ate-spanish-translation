 lesson_basics_resources_1_desc:2 "To further your goals you will need [gold|E]. Among other things, $game_concept_gold$ pays for [buildings|E], [armies|E], and bribes. $game_concept_gold$ is collected passively from both your [holdings|E] and your [vassals|E] as [tax|E].

Higher $game_concept_prestige_levels$ make other [characters|E] think better of you and bring powerful ways to wage $game_concept_war$.\n\n#TUT Some actions #EMP cost#! $game_concept_prestige$, like declaring $game_concept_war$. These actions allow you to leverage your celebrity for your own benefit, and $game_concept_characters$ won't think less of you for using them.\n\nSpending $game_concept_prestige$ does not affect your $game_concept_prestige_level$ progress, just your current $game_concept_prestige$.#!"

 lesson_basics_de_jure_titles_desc:4 "Most [titles|E] belong in a pyramid-like hierarchy, according to their $game_concept_title$ [title_tier|E]:\n\n[barony|E] — ruled by a Baron or Baroness\n[county|E] — ruled by a Count or Countess\n[duchy|E] — ruled by a Duke or Duchess\n[kingdom|E] — ruled by a King or Queen\n[empire|E] — ruled by an Emperor or Empress\n\nEvery $game_concept_title$ is legally part of a $game_concept_title$ one $game_concept_title_tier$ up the chain, for example each $game_concept_county$ is thus part of a $game_concept_duchy$.\n\n#TUT Note: There are many dynamic names for these Titles — your current [ruler|E] is in charge of a "Petty Kingdom" which corresponds to the [duchy|E] Tier.#!"
