 GENESIS_1_GLOSS:0 "#bold Genesis 1.1:#! In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
 JOHN_316_GLOSS:0 "#bold John 3.16:#! For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

 #MEXICO STUFF
 MEXICO_RULER_TITLE_GLOSS: "Within Mexican administrative philosophy, it is widely accepted that the titles and honorifics with which rulers style themselves hold no inherent importance, rather they are merely meant to broadly evoke certain historic periods, ideas, or aesthetics.\n\nThese include ones such as #bold Emperador#!, #bold Presidente#!, #bold Dictador#!, or #bold Benemérito#!. Additionally, particularly ambitious rulers have tried to give themselves new titles to symbolize changes within their governments, however these very rarely get remembered beyond their own time in power."
 REFORMA_GLOSS: "Meaning “Reform”, the #bold Reforma#! was a movement in Mexico’s past that strived to bring about a [Glossary( 'republic', 'REPUBLICA_GLOSS')] by eliminating the last vestiges of the [Glossary( 'Virreinato', 'VIRREINATO_GLOSS')] and its oppressive feudal traditions. In place of the incompetent hereditary governance of their opponents, the Reformistas favored a more meritocratic and effective system of power.\n\nThe victory of the Reforma is considered to be the foundation upon which the Mexican government is built."
 VIRREINATO_GLOSS: "Meaning “Viceroyalty”, #bold Virreinato#! is the term used to refer to Mexico as vassalized under a foreign [Glossary( 'monarchy', 'MONARQUIA_GLOSS')], a situation which ended with the Cry of Dolores and Mexican independence."
 MONARQUIA_GLOSS: "Meaning “Monarchy”, a #bold Monarquía#! is an archaic form of government which represents many of the worst and most self destructive practices which a society may develop. Weak, decentralized, corrupt, nepotistic, and lethargic, it is considered a grave insult for an administration to be mistaken for a monarchy.\n\nThankfully, there have never been any such governments in Mexico since independence, as all effective regimes are definitionally [Glossary( 'republics', 'REPUBLICA_GLOSS')]."
 REPUBLICA_GLOSS: "Meaning “Republic”, a #bold República#! is a centralized, powerful, and organized government that serves the interests of the populace through effective and decisive action. As it avoids [Glossary( 'democratic', 'DEMOCRACIA_GLOSS')] chaos and mob rule while preventing the stagnation and backwardness inherent to [Glossary( 'monarchy', 'MONARQUIA_GLOSS')], Mexico has survived as a República since independence, always keeping to these ideals even after almost nine-hundred years."
 DEMOCRACIA_GLOSS: "Meaning “Democracy”, #bold Democracia#! is anarchy in its purest and most dangerous form: the unfettered rule of the masses. It is a problem which Mexico has often faced, usually coming from the naïve musings of scholars and children, the disgruntled idle peasantry, or the decadent and out-of-touch elites. However, with strong [Glossary( 'republican', 'REPUBLICA_GLOSS')] institutions, this threat only appears during rare periods of crisis and civil unrest."
 REVOLUCION_GLOSS: "Meaning “Revolution”, the #bold Revolución#! was a movement in Mexico’s past that sought to expand the [Glossary( 'Reforma', 'REFORMA_GLOSS')] to include those in the peripheral regions of Mexico due to the entrenched dominance of the distant elites in Mexico City.\n\nIn addition, the Revolución increased administrative effectiveness by allowing peasants and women to attain government appointments and play a more active role in society. The victorious Revolución is considered to be the institutionalization of the ideals of [Glossary( 'republicanism', 'REPUBLICA_GLOSS')] in Mexico."
 CONSTITUCION_GLOSS: "Meaning “Constitution”, a #bold Constitución#! is a guiding philosophy which encompasses an ideal method of ruling and governance. While considered neither binding nor enforceable, following a Constitución is a laudable goal for all administrators and rulers to strive towards."
 GUERRAS_DE_LAS_ESPADAS_Y_CUCHILLOS_GLOSS: "Meaning #bold “Wars of the Swords and Knives”#!, named as such after the distinctive Coats of Arms which the warring houses used, was the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'wenceslao_najera' ).GetDynasty.GetName] dynastic civil war that not only ended the Golden Age of Mexico started by their patriarch and founder, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'wenceslao_najera' ).GetFullName], but also led to the eradication of the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'alejo_areaga' ).GetHouse.GetName] cadet branch. This devastating conflict lasted several generations and marked the start of a steep decline which Mexico has suffered from for the last two-hundred years."
