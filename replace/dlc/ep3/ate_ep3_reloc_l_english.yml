In the afternoon I dig my feet into warm sand and watch as clear waves wash over bleached fish bones. In the evening, I observe strange rites performed in a great shrine  illuminated by the moon. Where else could I ever feel the way I do when in Mexico?"
 ep3_laamps.8090.desc.world_caribbean_basin: "The waves gently lap at the beach as I watch the sun sink towards the horizon behind them. The peaceful tropical atmosphere is intoxicating and I feel as though my life before has been but a dream and only now am I truly awake."
 ep3_laamps.8090.desc.world_brazil_region: "In the heart of the jungle, I follow the Amazon River, its dark waters winding across the rainforest and the air around me humming with the sounds of countless creatures. I meet the indigenous peoples and learn their customs and their stories, passed down from generation to generation across the centuries. After days of navigating the wild, I emerge into civilization once again: the bustling city of Manaus. Yet, even here, I can hear the whispers of the forest, reminding me that the the mysteries of the unknown are never far away."
 ep3_laamps.8090.desc.world_greater_andes: "In these lands, I traverse towering glaciers and verdant valleys. I see resilient nomads, not just surviving, but thriving around these majestic mountains. I see herds of white furred alpacas and llamas grazing. Locals tell me that from from the peak of Aconcagua one can survey the known world. I hardly see the purpose in that, all I could ever want is here."
