 # MaA Flavour
 bondi_flavor:0 "#F The Yachtsmen are part of a class of free landholders, often competent sailors, that use longships to trade or to go viking. They fight using spears and shields.#!"
 vigmen_flavor:0 "#F Warriors in the front present an impenetrable wall of shields to protect archers in the rear. This tactic deters skirmishers while allowing a steady advance.#!"
 varangian_veterans_flavor:0 "#F Explorers, adventurers, warriors, and mercenaries from all around the United States. Some have even served in the Secret Service.#!"
 jomsviking_pirates_flavor:0 "#F Some of the most notorious reavers ever to ply the Great Lakes, the League excel at injecting chaos into battle, drawing it out before excelling in the aftermath.#!"
