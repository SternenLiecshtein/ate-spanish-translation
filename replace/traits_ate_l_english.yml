 trait_aquarius_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Water-Bearer, from whose vessel pours forth the many rivers and streams of California. Just as they make their way from mountain to surf, so too do we find our way in life from beginning to end. As Guru Kahanamoku once said, "Just take your time - wave comes. Let the other guys go, catch another one." We have but one life to live - let us not rush to its end!"
 trait_pisces_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Fish, which live in the endless reaches of the sea beneath the churn of the surf. They live in a world constantly in motion, just as we do. Guru Lee instructs us to "Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water," so as to surive and adapt. As they ancient idiom directs - Go with the flow!"
 trait_aries_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Ram, a combative and tempestuous creature. We must be wise in our actions and choose our battles, following the words of Guru Butler, who said "All struggles Are essentially Power struggles, And most are no more intellectual than two rams knocking their heads together." Redirect thoughts of anger and aggression and dive headfirst towards more productive endeavors - only then can we grow!"
 trait_taurus_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Bull, the male counterpart of the cow that is found all across the farms of California, providing meat and milk for us all. The Bull is a symbol of man's relationship with nature - a partnership of mutual dependence. Guru Muir understood this well when he said "Plants, animals, and stars are all kept in place, bridled along appointed ways, with one another, and through the midst of one another." We must remember that the great Circle of Life - the Wheel of Fortune - connects us all."
 trait_gemini_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Twins, which represent the many dyads we find in our daily lives - parent and child, past and future, heaven and earth. The Twins also represent out perpetual internal struggle to maintain our course on the sacred path toward a life of virtue. Guru Lucas reminds us of this constant decision making with his observation that "Everybody has the choice of being a hero or not being a hero every day of their lives." In order to live our best lives, we must commit to the path and remember to Do or Do Not. There is no Try."
 trait_cancer_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Crab, the well-armored and cantankerous creature that roam the seashores of California. It sheds its shell many times over the course of its life before emerging bigger and stronger than before. We too must constantly build up and improve ourselves so that we can best serve our community and Empire and fight against those who would do ill. We should reflect on the words of Guru Patton - a famed immortal warrior - who announced, "So forever in the future, Shall I battle as of yore, Dying to be born a fighter, But to die again, once more.""
 trait_leo_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Lion, a noble animal of myth that is said to have been granted great courage by a Wizard. The lion can be seen to represent bravery, strength, and nobility - a true King of Beasts! Though this creature is but a legend, it inspires us to look within and find our inner strength, just as Guru Schwarzenegger encouraged us to do, saying "Strength does not come from winning... When you make an impasse passable, that is strength." With enough effort, you'll be able to say Hasta la Vista to any problem you may face!"
 trait_virgo_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Maiden, a symbol of purity, hope and honor. She is also often associated with the virgin land and potential bounty of the earth - akin to the goddess of the Cascadians whom they call Gaia. In California, the maiden is remembered as a symbol of the empire's namesake - Queen Calafia, who affixed the Island of California to the rest of the continent with her great power. Calafia's labors continue to inspire us to try our hardest, as do the well-known words of Guru Huerta - "Sí se puede! Yes, it can be done!""
 trait_libra_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Scales, symbols of Justice, Balance and Righetousness. The Scales invite us to weigh our choices carefully so that we may make the correct decision. In fact, Guru Muhammad - peace be upon him - said himself that "Righteousness is good morality, and wrongdoing is that which wavers in your soul and which you dislike people finding out about." When faced with tough choices, we must look deep to find that wavering unbalance within ourselves and take action to correct it."
 trait_scorpio_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Scorpion, a deadly creature that inhabits the Mojave desert and other dry places of the continent. It is often maligned as a symbol of maliciousness, skullduggery, and harlotry, but more properly, it represents the greater concept of Danger. The world is full of dangers an it is only with a steadfast commitment to living a pure life that we can hope to navigate them. Guru Jesus remarked on the power that faith has over those that wish us ill - "In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all.""
 trait_sagittarius_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Archer, whose bow and arrow is pointed towards the heavens. Just as the archer aims himself steadfastly upwards, so too must we maintain focused on constantly improving ourselves, and keep our mind turned heavenward. Guru Gautama spoke much of the power of meditation as a means of establishing that focus, reminding us that "Whatever a mother, father or other kinsman might do for you, the well-directed mind can do for you even better." True enlightenment can be found within ourselves - all we have to do is look!"
 trait_capricorn_guru_desc:0 "This character was born under the sign of the Sea-Goat, a symbol of transition and adaptation and of land and sea. Though perhaps an amusingly bizarre creature, it is emblematic of change in all forms and a reminder that we should embrace these transformations. Guru Le Guin once asked, "Would you have the sea grow still and the tides cease, to save one wave, to save yourself?" Though we may fear change and it what it brings, it is the natural order of things to grow and evolve. To struggle against this is folly - both futile and dishonorable."
