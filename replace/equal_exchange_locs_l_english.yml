 exchange.002.t:0 "An Exchange"

 exchange.003.t:0 "An Offering of Wealth"

 exchange.006.t:0 "An Offering of Wealth"
 exchange.006.desc:0 "The artifact is placed upon the altar, seeming now more magnificent than it ever was when I possesed it. I breifly think of snatching it back but I know only ill would befall me if I tried."

 exchange.007.t:0 "An Offering of The Flesh"
 exchange.007.desc:0 "The pin pricks my finger and soon drops of blood begin to fall. Quickly, I move my hand over the altar and watch it slowly drip down into the platter below. I can't help but feel squemish at the sight."

 exchange.008.t:0 "An Offering of The Flesh"
 exchange.008.desc:0 "Despite the remedies I took to dull the pain, the procedure is still very long and painful. But eventually the leg is completely removed and offered. While my wound is teneded to, I can't help but wonder if it was enough."

 exchange.010.t:0 "An Offering of The Flesh"
 exchange.010.desc:0 "I hold my knife up to the bottom of my chin, and slowly begin the long and painful process of peeling the flesh away. Damn the pain! When it is done the shredded remnants cannot fit upon the platter but I'm certian that is unessecary for the gift to be accepted."
 exchange.010.a:0 "May this offering suffice..."
