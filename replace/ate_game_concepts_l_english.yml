 game_concept_the_event_ate_desc: "The Event was an unclear disaster or set of disasters that occurred around six or seven hundred years before 2666.

However, some groups may possess a certain level of anxiety about what has been lost because of it, while others may invest themselves in attempting to recreate or restore the world as they imagine it once was."
