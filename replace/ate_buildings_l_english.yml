 building_type_kingman_mine_01_desc:1 "Sourced from the oldest and most prolific turquoise mine in North America, Kingman turquoise is by weight more valuable than gold or diamonds. The Kingman mine produces a unique variety of turquoise, its sky blue color laced with a matrix of white, black, and reddish-brown due to its high copper content.\n\nWhile highly valued for its aesthetical beauty, cultures across the continent consider turquoise capable of granting special power to objects. The Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache use the stones in their amulets for spiritual protection, while further south the native peoples of Central America, such as the Maya, use the stones to decorate sacred artifacts used in ceremonies. These cultures travel from near and far to trade, bringing with them the spices and wares of different lands."

With Chicago's architecture in need of repair after centuries of neglect, post-Event leaders turned to local history for a solution within the bounds of current capabilities, and found their answer in the tales of the 'White City,' a gleaming white architectural complex of neoclassical contruction based on symmetry and splendor. While the original complex only lasted around a year, its cultural impact was such that enough records survived to reconstruct something similar, and the new complex now serves as the city center of Chicago. Plus, many surviving pre-Event monuments are included throughout the complex, such as the Victory Monument and the Fountain of the Great Lakes. At its center is a grand cathedral in a neo-Gothic Revival style, drawing pilgrims from all over the Midwest and beyond to worship and pay homage."
