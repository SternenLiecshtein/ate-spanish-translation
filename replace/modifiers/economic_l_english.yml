 economy.0001.t:0 "Stable Economy!"
 economy.0001.desc:0 "The economic nature of the state has been about as good as anyone could expect according to my economic advisers. Trade both foreign and domestic is chugging along, and tax revenue is stable. This has resulted in a filled treasury. Minus a sudden upturn of exorbitant spending that might accompany a new war or a natural disaster we should continue on this stable trend for the foreseeable future."
 economy.0001.a:0 "That is a relief"
 
 economy.0002.t:0 "Unstable Economy!"
 economy.0002.desc:0 "It had been brought to my attention that for the economic health of the realm I should cut back in some areas of spending or otherwise find a new way to bring in revenue to the state. This is because the economy as its stands is on a slow downturn that can fortunately still be reversed before it reaches disastrous levels. Some projects will have to be halted for the time being or we could be looking at a recession in a year or two. I must use what remains in the treasury to turn this around."
 economy.0002.a:0 "This is worrying"
 
 economy.0003.t:0 "Stable Economy!"
 economy.0003.desc:0 "My Steward has come forth to inform me that the realms treasury is not just overflowing, but that the state is experiencing a economic boom in every sector from trade, tax revenue and even domestic commerce. It is truly a sign of my exalted reign that this has been allowed to happen. As a sign of appreciation, the local traders gathered a large sum of gold."
 economy.0003.a:0 "We shall use the gift to attract more traders"
 economy.0003.b:0 "Send it to the realm treasury"
 economy.0003.c:0 "We shall return the gift"
 
 economy.0004.t:0 "Unstable Economy!"
 economy.0004.desc:0 "a frowned treasurer informs me that The economy has hit a recession, the cause of such horrible economic trends point towards mismanagement at the highest levels of the realm. While the treasurer is carful not to directly blame me for the abysmal state of the economy the tone of his voice is clear. Something must be done, people are hungry, raised soldiers need pay and lower ranking nobles are smelling blood in the water and are on the brink of revolt."
 economy.0004.a:0 "Sell a vassal's independance"
 economy.0004.b:0 "Sell minor titles"
 economy.0004.c:0 "We could handle a revolt"
