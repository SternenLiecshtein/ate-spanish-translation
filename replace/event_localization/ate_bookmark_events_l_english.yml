 lengacher.0001.t: "The Chain"
 lengacher.0001.desc: "I am the King of the Deitscherei. I am the heir of two hundred years of peace and prosperity. The fruits of two centuries of my family’s humility and piousness are enjoyed across the realm. Every day I bear witness to the modest triumphs of my people. Yet, despite all that I have been blessed with, there is a lingering discomfort. The aches of guilt from a failed obligation.\n\nMy dear Isadora… how I wish we had been lucky. Thirty years of marriage, and not a single child to show for it. Our vows to each other are eternal, and to defy them would be unthinkable. Impossible, even. And yet, every day a sense of dread creeps over me. The knowledge that my house’s two hundred year lineage shall end with me sinks deeper into my spirit, dragging me into a mire of fear and guilt. Unless…"

 lengacher.0001.a: "I will do what I must to ensure that the bloodline survives!"

 lengacher.0002.t: "November Rain"
 lengacher.0002.desc: "Each night, when I go to sleep, I begin to resent the next morning more and more. I wake up and take a look at my wife. I realize she is very plain. My whole life, in fact, has featured few pleasures or joys. Now, the end seems to only grow closer, and I wonder about whether I have ever truly enjoyed my time on earth. With these sad thoughts flooding my mind, I set out alone to reflect on this overcast morning.\n\nI sit underneath a tree, looking out onto a forest broken by a calm stream. The rain has begun to softly drizzle, clattering off the leaves. I feel it will soon pick up into a storm. Suddenly, the peaceful monotony is interrupted by an weak cry. A shrill, lonely wail… is that the sound of a baby? A baby floating along in the reeds?"

 lengacher.0002.a: "No, I am completely alone in misery."
 lengacher.0002.b: "A son! A gift from God in the form of an abandoned babe!"
 lengacher.0003.c: "Those are the cries of a child. I must save it!"

 beaton.0001.t: "Come Together"
 beaton.0001.desc: "For fifty-five long, stressful, joyous, messy, lovely, awful years, I have been the High Queen of Tìramara, Lady of the Maritimes. And by the [unknown_saviour|E], it has not been easy! I have ruled much longer than most in my position, and overseen cooperation between the various peoples of these cold shores. And I have done my best to keep the problems of my subjects from tearing Tìramara into pieces. Despite the triumph of merely surviving, I have not yet been able to see my people thrive. Moreover, I fear that my heirs will be elected to a kingdom that they cannot hold.\n\nThe Maritimes, and by extension, my family face three major issues. The island lords of the Mi'kmaq have ceased acknowledging my rule, and ideally should be brought back into the fold. The northwestern Acadiens are beginning to chafe against my authority through the leadership of [jacques.GetTitledFirstName]. And the cockroach-like Irvings remain a painful thorn in my side. If I have any hope of making sure my heirs are elected, I need to quash these problems. How am I going to do that?"

 beaton.0002.t: "Burning Bridges"
 beaton.0002.desc: "Since beginning the work required to bring the fringes of the Maritimes beneath my control, two complications have arisen. The first, which I have no recourse towards, is the influx of mercenaries and adventurers flocking to the banners of [daniel.GetFirstNameNicknamed] in response to my efforts. The fiend has promised tax breaks and bits of land to those that would serve his cause, which has made it easy enough for him to secure willing warriors. The second issue, which I do have some ability to mitigate, are the efforts by [jacques.GetTitledFirstName] and [dergavel.GetTitledFirstName] to prepare their realms for some unclear upcoming conflict. At present, I may be able to assuage one of the two, although I have not yet decided which. Alternatively, it could be more wise to not divert from my current plans."

 beaton.0002.a: "The only change I'll make is to hire [elcid.GetFirstNameNicknamed] as backup!"
 beaton.0002.b: "The crimes of the Irvings have been punished sufficiently."
 beaton.0002.c: "Could the Acadien lands benefit from some investments?"

 beaton.0003.t: "Acadien Driftwood"
 beaton.0003.desc: "The right thing to do is obviously to negotiate and compromise. Afterall, Tìramara is a land of many peoples, and despite their false gods, the Acadiens are my subjects too. My messages to [jacques.GetTitledFirstName] have focused on promises of autonomy and tolerance. So far, nothing concrete has been agreed to, but it seems like the relations between myself and [jacques.GetTitledFirstName] have improved to the point where I doubt that he will be much of a threat for the time being. Now the question is, how do I capitalize on this further?"

 beaton.0003.a: "Let us try diplomacy with the Mi'kmaw..."
 beaton.0003a.tooltip: "[daniel.GetTitledFirstName] enters a mutual [alliance|E] with you"

 beaton.0003c.tooltip: "[jacques.GetTitledFirstName] enters a mutual [alliance|E] with you"

 beaton.0004.t: "Why Can't We Be Friends?"
 beaton.0004.desc: "The Irvings and the Beatons have feuded for centuries. I know that whatever I do in the remainder of my life will be unlikely to end the bad blood between our families, but I must still try. [dergavel.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to begin negotiations on reconciliation, however, I must decide how I will approach the prospect. Will I be like my father, [basil.GetFirstNameNicknamed]? Will I prepare the Irvings for my succession? Or will I try something radically different?"

 beaton.0004.a: "This was all a ruse. The legacy of [basil.GetFirstNameNicknamed] lives on in me!"
 beaton.0004.b: "Hate me if you must, but let my children have a clean slate."
 beaton.0004.c: "It is time for the Beatons and Irvings to have a new relationship..."

Yet, though the realm is fractured, they still hold Québec and some pretenses of legitimacy.

I somehow instinctively know that this is [alphonse.GetFirstName], the founder of the Soady Clan. He reassures me, and explains that to shoot straight does not mean to follow a rigid path set by your upbringing.

This unfortunate moniker follows many powerful women of the Josias family.\n\nDuke Richard Josias was considered a prime contender for the leadership of the Commonwealth and ran against Duke Agamenticus Littlepage of Lowcountry. His lack of a male heir and the specter of the old and slanderous title on his daughters, however, caused his succession to be questioned and, in the eyes of House Josias, robbed him of the crown. When Agamenticus was crowned, Richard apparently died of a heart attack and left his realm to his eldest daughter who was then only 18.\n\nDuchess Anastasia has proved to be a magnanimous and charismatic ruler, opening up the Cadmean Hall for yearly festivals and celebrations and unfurling the banner of the pierced heart with pride. Renowned as one of the most beautiful women in the Commonwealth, her powerful title renders her the most eligible belle in the entire South. Some wonder if there is any match suitable for a woman as shrewd, fair, and wealthy as Anatasia. Time will tell if she will accept a lower match, for it seems that nothing is above her except the Imperial Crown itself."

 camiroaga.0001.desc: "I find myself in my carriage, headed to the Congress of Valparaíso, admiring the hills of the so-called Pearl of the Pacific. Some paths, now indistinguishable from the others, are said to have once held the ‘ascensores’. I recall stories from my grandpa, who told that in Old Chile, these machines assisted the Porteños in navigating the hills of the city. They were stripped down for steel after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E], with some of the structures set up to scrap them eventually becoming renowned forges, or so their blacksmiths say. Commoners and burghers gather around the streets, trying to catch a glimpse of the arrivals to the Baburizza Palace—an old mansion used by [valpolord.GetTitledFirstName] and the seat for the upcoming Congress\n\nThe Congress is composed of the lords and ladies of 'El Centro,' those who, after the signing of ‘El Cahuín de Vitacura’, elected me as Lord of the Central Valleys—leader of the rebellion and, in practice, liege to all of them. We are here to discuss the future of our lands after the Flight to Curicó, from the so-called 'loyal' court of the absent Don [chilelord.GetFirstName], #EMP former #!King of Chile. As I start to remember the years before the rebellion, struggling to get a word with him and usually finding him tending to his horse or in his study, neglecting his duties, my carriage suddenly stops, and my driver tells me, "We have arrived, Don Felipe.""

 camiroaga.0002.desc: "As I enter the casona, I see various figures from Valparaíso and Santiago high society, here to attend to their lords. Don [valpolord.GetFirstName] rises from his chair to grab some food, and another attendant swiftly takes his seat. [valpolord.GetFirstName], the Alcalde of Valparaíso, talks to some servants, while a few noblemen discuss building a house in one of the resort towns on the coast.\n\nAs people notice my presence, slowly but surely, a line forms to greet and exchange a few words with me. Nobles and burghers alike—faces from all over the Central Valley smile at me, both in feigned and genuine warmth. I realize that, even after years in my position, my leadership status still troubles me."

 camiroaga.0003.desc: "The hours pass, and our conversations cover various topics, including fortress-keeping, winemaking rights and grants, compensation for various peasant communities and unions affected by the war, and other minor topics. As this happens, I hear [valpolord.GetTitledFirstName] approach me, "Don Felipe, as you know, the ancient rights of Valparaíso were rescinded by kings of Chile's past. We Porteños have been loyal to the cause, but the structures and traditions of our beloved port should, in our opinion," he says, referring to the people of Valparaíso, "be restored."\n\nI pause. Is he asking for the restoration of Gran Valparaíso? San Antonio's lords would be back under Porteño suzerainty! Valparaíso used to be a powerful naval power until its election of the King of Chile as Governor. Restoring such a powerful title and institution would certainly benefit trade and make him a strong ally for the rest of the Central Valley, but this move could grant de facto independence, and the Porteños may become as rowdy as the penquistas of Concepción."

I wonder-..."Felipe!" she exclaims—"The former King and the rest of the court are still in Curicó. Are we just going to sit here and do nothing? The Naranjos are waiting to jump in and have our heads once Tulio makes up his mind!" Other lords cheer her on, but [joaquin.GetTitledFirstName] rises from his chair and declares, "Our rights and privileges are asserted now! Why should we go and campaign down south when we clearly have achieved the rebellion’s purpose!". Others, like Don [quillotalord.GetFirstName] of Quillota, support Catalina. I remember how during the rebellion he pushed for me to claim the throne, as we, the Camiroagas, married into past royal families—but I refused.\n\nAll these factions were dormant during the rebellion, but it seems that this congress reactivated them. Who shall I support? They clearly are waiting for me to say something. Four paths seem to pass through my mind as the lords raise their voices and the dispute gains steam."

 ate_bookmark.874.desc: "I was born in a workshop lost in Florida, surrounded by a family of acclaimed artists. The Artesanos raised me from a young age to be one of them. I was trained in all the arts of men with the promise that one day I would create something so great it would mend the wounds of our world. But this life was simply not for me. I failed over and over again. What was I to create when the prospect of my whole life was encased within the old walls of the workshop? What creation can grow from someone who has never experienced life at its fullest?\n\nIt was too much for me, and one day when the candles went out, I walked away from the workshop. I made a living working as a wandering doctor, and in time, many joined with me to learn and keep helping others. I saw the polished lakes of Córdoba, the endless curtains of water at Iguazú, the golden beaches of Florianópolis, and the sprawling streets of Buenos Aires. I helped wherever I could, and I even found a muse to journey with.\n \nBut still I feel an emptiness. Now that I see the world in its entirety, I do not feel the same disgust I once felt for those who raised me. Perhaps they were harsh and demanding, yes, but they taught me to see where other men walk blind. The power is held in the hands of those who believe they can twist the world into something that it's not. And am I not like them? Did I not believe that I could discover the world as it truly is through my own eyes alone? I cannot run from what the Equilibrium has placed upon me. If the brush must once again rest in my hands, then perhaps it's time to paint a new beginning."
