OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_RAVEN: "#italic I sit in my chambers at midnight, and hear something tapping at my window. I fling open the casement, dark wings fluttered wildy as a Raven dives into my room, coming to a rest on the frame of the door. It squawks, and shakes it’s shadowy body. I shout at it “Leave me! Get off my Door!” To which it turns it’s curious head, and watching with deep black eyes replies simply, “Nevermore.”#!"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_AMIGARA_FAULT: "#italic I am on a mountain side, far from any signs of civilisation and yet before me is a carved hole cut perfectly in the shape of a man. The silhouette is familiar, and I realise that the hole is my perfect fit. I strip off my clothes, and clamber into the carving, filled with an overcoming sense of belonging. Once I am inside, I begin to slide down into the deep, subterranean unknown.#!"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_SHINING: "#italic I sit on a throne within a great stone hall, opposite me, on the hall’s far end are two Great Doors. They stand solid and stoic, but before I can stand, they begin to open - though there is no one present to pull them ajar. As the entrance expands, a great ocean of blood spills forth into the hall. Splashing against the walls in giant crimson waves. The rush of liquid pushes the door open more, until a great sanguine torrent is able to collapse into the hall and wash away me and my throne.#!"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_PAGEMASTER: "#italic I stand on a tower of books in an endless ocean of ink, tentacles whip at the tower’s sides and the black liquid bubbles and squirms unnaturally. All around me are piles of books beyond number, but there is one sitting on a pedestal. It is thick and black, emblazoned with the sigil of a tentacled horror. Something draws me to it, and I flip open its pages. It is written with unknowable scribbles and esoteric drawings. I move to close it, but its words transfigure into tendrils which wrap around my body and drag me into it’s pages.#!"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_THE_MIST: "#italic I stand on a tower in a keep, overlooking my lands that are blanketed in a thick fog. There are distance sounds of fighting, and screams of pain. A deep, gutteral roar echoes throughout the settlement, and deep in the fog I see the shadow of a great beast. It is four-legged, but it’s form is shifting, tentacles wobbled from its front, tasting the air and the ground. I take my sword, to slit my throat, knowing that this is no world in which to live.#!"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_CTHULU: "#italic I am on a ship, in a dark, slimy sea. At Starboard is a rocky island, with a city constructed of black, wet, cyclopean stones. It's towers reach high into the green sky. The waves that lap at it's shores are greasy, muddy and choked with weeds and dead sealife. As the ship approaches, there is a great call from the deep. The water bubbles and from the shadows a colossal tentacled mass emerges in burst of black sea water. The Creature rises above the waves, barely in the shape of a man, flexing it's wings. It is then, my mind is lost to madness.#"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_JOKER: "#italic Rain pelts down around me, I am in the middle of a village street. The water runs downhill around me, but I can barely see infront of me through the heavy fall. I move forward, clothes already soaked. As I push forward, the silhouette of a figure becomes clearer infront of me. It is a Jester, and while his features are obscured, I can tell his skin his pale and hair is wild and frizzy. It beckons me forwards, waving its hands and cackling.#!"
OCCULTIST_MYSTIC_MOUNTAINS_OF_MADNESS: "#italic I push through a blizzard in a frozen land, climbing carefully up a mountain afraid I might slip and lose myself in the deep snow. Finally, I crest the top of the peak, and come upon an ancient city. It’s architecture is inhuman, made of large black stones interlocking with one another. No human could have ever called this cursed place home, nevertheless, I am driven into it’s twisting streets.#!"
GENERIC_MYSTIC_LEIBOWITZ: "#italic I stand on the gangway of a great ship sitting upon a mountain, waiting to depart into the sky. I look down at the far away villages and cities the lay at the base, and I watch with a horrific resignation as great flashes of light and mushrooms of fire sweep it all away. As the brightness begins to scorch my skin and blind my vision, I turn to depart, leaving the desolation behind.#!"
