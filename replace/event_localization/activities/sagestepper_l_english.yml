 sagestepper.100.t:0 "The Stone Bones"
 sagestepper.100.desc:0 "It is said that The Almighty's return will be heralded by a great number of steeds with stone bones awakening from an ancient slumber to rise from the earth and gallop across the land one last time. However one of these slumbering steeds has been uncovered prematurely on your land, and it falls to you to decide what should be done with the steed"
 sagestepper.100.a:0 "Such a fine steed would look great next to my throne!"
 sagestepper.100.b:0 "Return the bones to the earth so that it may continue it's slumber"
 
 sagestepper.101.t:0 "The Sacred Smoke"
 sagestepper.101.desc:0 "The fire ignites quickly, soon consuming the tinder and spreading to surrounding sagebrush. If all goes as planned, the smoke from this fire will drive out all the fearsome critters for miles around."
 sagestepper.101.a:0 "This ought to clear them out"
 
 sagestepper.102.t:0 "Something in the smoke?"
 sagestepper.102.desc:0 "In the wisps of smoke rapidly speading across the land, you and your courtiers can make out the shape of something quickly moving in the smoke. As soon as it appeared, the figure in the smoke vanished. Leaving you and others struggling to figue out what thing was."
 sagestepper.102.a:0 "It must have been a fearsome critter! Quick, Burn more sage!"
 sagestepper.102.b:0 "What was that?"
 sagestepper.102.c:0 "It was just a trick of the light"
 
 sagestepper.103.t:0 "Playing With Fire"
 sagestepper.103.desc:0 "The fire burns hot and bright before you, 'surely this will purify the land of any fearsome critters that taint this land' you think to yourself. You almost don't notice the wind suddenly shifting direction towards you, bringing a thick plume of smoke and a hail of embers in your direction. While you stamp out the embers that land on the dry ground, you don't notice the embers landing on your clothes. That is until you feel a burning sensation spreading across your leg."
 sagestepper.103.a:0 "Stop drop and roll!"
 
 sagestepper.104.t:0 "A Successful Burn"
 sagestepper.104.desc:0 "The smoke clears and the last of the smoldering fires burn themselves out, you and your courtiers congratulate eachother for another successful burn."
 sagestepper.104.a:0 "We shouldn't have to deal with any fearsome critters for a while after this"
 
 sagestepper.105.t:0 "WILDFIRE!"
 sagestepper.105.desc:0 "You watch with horror as the fire rapidly spreads beyond it's planned area, burning all in it's path. Pasture land, cattle, and homes all go up in smoke. When the fire eventually burns itself out, the land is black and ash wafts through the air. You let out a sigh of releif when you notice that all your courtiers managed to escape the inferno."
 sagestepper.105.a:0 "This could not have gone any worse"
