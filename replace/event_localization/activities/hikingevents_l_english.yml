 hiking.116.desc:0 "As my entourage is battered by heavy rain, I searched desperately for a place to shelter until the weather clears. It is then I come upon several ruins, hidden by overgrowth. The rubble is clearly of antediluvian origin, but the remaining walls provide adequate shelter to the storm. One of my companions shouts over the tempest. \n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] should we seek shelter here?!"\n\n"

 hiking.117.desc:0 "As I hike through one of the more deslote trails in my path, the rough terrain keeps my eyes focused at the ground. Heaving, I suddenly get the odd feeling of being watched. I look up, to see a black shaggy creature disapper from the path uphill into the surrounding brush. I'm frozen by shock and astonishment. I've heard of such forest creatures, but legend says that sightings are rare."
 hiking.117.a:0 "Such a rare chance! I must pursue it!"

It seems to know the forest well, and dodges between trees as I struggle to avoid falling. I barely can make out its outline ahead as I continue the chase. However, when I emerge into a forest clearing, I see that the spirit has stopped at the tree line opposite to me. It turns back, large black eyes meeting mine. It lets out a low groan, then dashes back into the forest, disappearing."

It seems to know the forest well, and dodges between trees as I struggle to avoid falling. I barely can make out its outline ahead as I continue the chase. A momentary lapse in my speed let the spirit disappear between the trees, but I continued in the same direction. It is then I come to a cliffside, overlooking a drop into dense forest. There is no way the creature could have disappeared without my notice, but all the same - it is gone."

Confused, I fasten my approach and watch with horror as a small group go about deforesing the surrounding area. Lumberjacks cut down the strong and ancient trees for their quality wood. These are sacred woods, protected by the surrounding realms. They are clearly here illegally."
