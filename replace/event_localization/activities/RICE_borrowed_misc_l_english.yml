The bee products they produce like honey and beeswax sell for high prices on foreign markets, thus bringing us much wealth and tax money.\n\nHowever, sometimes, the tax these beekeepers pay is not enough. Sometimes, we need more.\n\nI have thus ordered the beekeepers of my realm to provide us more tribute this year than I normally request of them. They already profit a lot from the trade, and have various privileges associated with it – extracting a little more tribute from them surely won’t hurt."
