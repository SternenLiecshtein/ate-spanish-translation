 romaria.005.t:0 "The journey begins"
 romaria.005.desc:0 "I stand outside my family's estate, mounted on my horse and surrounded by my entourage. My closest relatives have gathered to see me off, their eyes filled with sadness and concern. They know that the journey to Aparecida is a long and dangerous one, and they fear for my safety.\n\nI, however, assure them they have nothing to worry. After all, I can't help but feel a sense of excitement - I have heard stories of the miracles that had occurred at the shrine of Mãe-Maria, and hoped that I too would be blessed with a sign from above.\n\nAs I look out over the vast countryside, I understand that I am embarking on a journey that will change myself forever, a journey that will test my faith and my resolve. And with that, I urge my horse forward, riding off with my entourage by my side." 
 romaria.005.a:0 "We ride to the holy city"

 romaria.006.t:0 "Approaching Aparecida"
 romaria.006.desc:0 "Even if my band is still a few hours away from our destination, I swear I can already hear the bells of the ancient temple in the distance! As we keep riding, I find myself humming the familiar tune of a hymn: 'Romaria', the song that lends its name to this pilgrimage and had been passed down through my family for generations.\n\n #S 'Sou caipira, pirapora, Nossa Senhora de Aparecida...'#! \n\nI can't help but think about the deeper meaning of the song, about the power of faith and the importance of seeking redemption. The lyrics speak to me in a profound way, reminding me of the struggles I have faced in my life - as a ruler, as a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] - and the hope that I have found in my faith.\n\n #S 'Se há sorte, eu não sei, nunca vi...'#! \n\nAs we continue the final hours of our journey, the song keeps echoing through my mind, filling myself with a sense of peace. I feel tears welling up in my eyes. I know know that this is a voyage that I will never forget, something that will stay with me for the rest of my life."
 romaria.006.a:0 "Just a few more hours..."

 romaria.007.t:0 "The holy city"
 romaria.007.desc:0 "Our group has crossed the gates of Aparecida, our horses' hooves kicking up clouds of dust. We have been traveling for weeks, crossing the rugged terrain with only the occasional stream to quench our thirst. But now, here we are - The holy city, sacred for Apostolics, Conterrâneos and countless other faiths.\n\n #S 'É de sonho e de pó o destino de um só, feito eu perdido em pensamentos sobre o meu cavalo...' #! \n\nAs we ride into the town, our party was greeted by the sight of thousands of pilgrims from all over [old_brazil|E], gathered to pay their respects to Our Lady of Aparecida. We dismount and join the throng, weaving our way through the crowds towards the shrine, while singing the centuries old hymn.\n\n #S 'O meu pai foi peão, minha mãe solidão. Meus irmãos perderam-se na vida...' #!\n\nInside the old temple, the air is thick with the scent of incense and the murmur of prayers in a dozen languages. Me and my companions kneel in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, our rough hands clasped in supplication. For us, that is not just an icon of Mãe-Maria, the mother of Jesus - But a symbol of strength and resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n #S 'Me disseram, porém, que eu viesse aqui, pra pedir em romaria e prece paz nos desaventos...'#!\n\nWe know that their journey back to [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] will be a long and arduous one, but we feel renewed by our pilgrimage to Aparecida. As we mount our horses and set off towards home, they are filled with a sense of purpose and a renewed commitment to our way of life. For us, our faith in the Virgin Mother is a beacon of hope in a world that is often harsh and unforgiving.\n\n #S 'Sou caipira, pirapora, Nossa Senhora de Aparecida. Ilumina a mina escura e funda o trem da minha vida...'#!"
 romaria.007.a:0 "A glorious experience..."

 romaria.008.desc:0 "We begin our journey back to our domain, tired and worn out but filled with a sense of peace and contentment. As I mount my horse, I take a deep breath and close my eyes, reflecting on the spiritual journey I have just undertaken. By walking the same path that my ancestors did in the past, I have discovered a renewed sense of faith and purpose - And I also understood that I am ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."
 romaria.008.a:0 "This journey has taught me the true meaning of faith"
 romaria.008.b:0 "I've faced many perils on this journey, and I've overcome all"
 romaria.008.c:0 "I've learned that moderation is the true path to salvation"
 romaria.008.d:0 "The true path to salvation implies giving up temptation"
 romaria.008.e:0 "This pilgrimage has already taught me enough"

 romaria.009.t:0 "Bandit attack!"
 romaria.009.desc:0 "As the sun begins to set, me and my entourage notice a group of shadowy figures in the distance. Before we could react, dozens of bandits descend upon us, their swords and spears flashing in the fading light. Chaos erupts as everyone scrambles to defend themselves, swords clashing against swords, the sound of screams filling the air. In the midst of the mayhem, I have to make a split-second decision: To fight back with all our might or to flee for our lives."
 romaria.009.a:0 "We face the attackers head-on!"
 romaria.009.a.success:0 "We beat them!"
 romaria.009.b.failure:0 "They beat us and take our gold!"
 romaria.009.b:0 "Flee and let them have whatever they want!"

 romaria.010.t:0 "A strange mystic"
 romaria.010.desc:0 "A mere two weeks into our journey, as we were descending a hill, our entourage was approached by a strange figure - A person which spoke with a silver tongue, expounding on the nature of the universe and the role of mankind in it. Although these words are eloquent and inspiring, they carry with them a sense of danger and unease. As the conversation continues, I can't help but feel as if I were being drawn into some sort of mystical trap. Is this person a sorcerer or a witch, using their powers to lure unsuspecting travelers to their doom? Or is there some deeper meaning to their words that I have yet to uncover?"
 romaria.010.a:0 "These ideas are dangerous... But so fascinating..."
 romaria.010.b:0 "Embrace these ideas and invite this holy person to our court!"
 romaria.010.c:0 "This unorthodox preaching only served to strengthen my true faith!"
 romaria.010.d:0 "Ignore this poor soul and continue our travel"
 romaria.010.e:0 "Put an end to this witch's misery!"

 romaria.011.t:0 "A zealous priest"
 romaria.011.desc:0 "As our entourage journeyed on, we were approached by a priest, who was well-versed in the teachings of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText|U], the holy book of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith. However, as we conversed, it became clear that the priest's interpretations of the sacred stories were more extreme than what we were used to. Some of those teachings seemed to veer off into dangerous territory, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Was this priest a true interpreter of the faith, or was that just some twisting of the teachings of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] for some other, nefarious ends? As we continue on our journey, our group can't help but ponder the meaning of the holy person's words and the impact they might have on our own spiritual journey..."
 romaria.011.a:0 "I must strive to become as zealous as this priest!"
 romaria.011.b:0 "Embrace these views and invite this person to our court!"
 romaria.011.c:0 "Although I don't completely agree with these ideas, this person should join us..."
 romaria.011.d:0 "This literal interpretation of the holy texts is too radical for my taste..."

 romaria.012.t:0 "The Marian worshippers"
 romaria.012.desc:0 "As I continue my journey towards the holy city of Aparecida, our caravan is slowly joined by other groups - Christians, Conterrâneos, even some Modernists! At every stop, the various entourages have the opportunity to talk and discuss the differences between their faiths, but also their common points - Specially, our deep respect for Mãe-Maria, the Virgin Mary. Me and my group find out that every faith has its own unique way of showing devotion to the Virgin. Some light candles and say prayers, others meditate in deep respect, while others make pilgrimages to different shrines dedicated to her - Such as the ancient basilica at Aparecida. It appears that the Mother of Christ has a universal appeal, and that her message of love and compassion transcends any one particular religion..."
 romaria.012.a:0 "They may be heretics, but they are all good people!"
 romaria.012.b:0 "Nonsense. They deserve nothing but our disdain!"
