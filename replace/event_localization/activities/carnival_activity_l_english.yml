 carnival.0002.t:0 "Celebrate Carnival!"
 
 carnival.0002.desc:0 "Carnival, this strange fusion between sacred and profane, is one of the staples of our culture. Every year, between the months of January and April, our streets are taken by a whole week of song, dance, amusement and much, #italic much#! more. It's the one time of the year when nobles and commons can be seen on the same feasts and most - well, #italic many#! at least! - rules are lifted in the name of merriment. We could use the date to organize a great carnival ball in our court. After all, we deserve some fun! And remember: Whatever happens in Carnival stays in Carnival!"
 
 carnival.0002.a:0 "Count me in! Only the dead won't be there!"
 
 carnival.0002.b:0 "Nah, I'd rather have good night's sleep..."
 
 carnival.0002.a.tt_10:0 "Everything goes #positive_value well#! in Carnival"
 
 carnival.0002.a.tt_11:0 "Your actions are a bit #negative_value excessive#! during Carnival"
 
 carnival.0002.a.tt_12:0 "Your behavior is a bit #negative_value indiscreet#! during Carnival"
 
 carnival.0002.a.tt_13:0 "Your decisions are a bit #negative_value irresponsible#! during Carnival"
 
 carnival.0002.a.tt_14:0 "You engage in #negative_value sinful#! activities during Carnival"

 carnival.0002.a.tt_15:0 " You commit #negative_value unforgettable#! acts during Carnival"
 
 carnival.0010.t:0 "It all went well in Carnival!"
 
 carnival.0010.desc:0 "We had an excellent Carnival this year! Amazing food and drink, incredible balls and parades, good company... And better yet: No hangover and no #italic regrets#!, let's put it this way. With an entire week of partying gone, we can finally return to real life. After all, as they say, #italic the year only starts after Carnival!#!"
 
 carnival.0010.b:0 "Eventually, every Carnival meets its end..."
 
 carnival.0011.t:0 "Carnival: What a shame..."
 
 carnival.0011.desc:0 "Every Carnival meets its end eventually... Finally! It seems I may have put #S too much#! effort into having fun, and now I'm the talk of the court. My reputation may have taken a hit, but hey - It's Carnival, so I'm not the only one, at least! Plus, everyone will forget all this over the course of the year, until it's time for the next Carnival!"
 
 carnival.0011.a:0 "Now I just need to rest a bit..."
 
 carnival.0011.b:0 "You will never have a hangover if you keep on #italic *ick!*#! drinking"
 
 carnival.0011.c:0 "I had the banquet of a lifetime!"
 
 carnival.0011.d:0 "What did I even #italic smoke#!... I don't care, bring me more!"
 
 carnival.0012.t:0 "Carnival: Indiscreet behavior"
 
 carnival.0012.desc:0 "They say that #italic Whatever happens in Carnival stays in Carnival#!, but that's not always the truth. After a week of heavy partying, drinks, dancing and good (#bold amazing!#!) company, rumors of my... Ehm... #italic Indiscreet behavior#! abound at court. Some say I should embrace my reputation, maybe deny the gossip, or even pretend I was intoxicated the whole time... Luckily, by the time of next year's Carnival, everyone will have forgotten about all this... Right?"
 
 carnival.0012.a:0 "Such shame! I should just pray for my soul!"
 
 carnival.0012.b:0 "Yeah, I spent the #italic whole week#! at the brothel, so what!?"
 
 carnival.0012.c:0 "I did #italic what#!? With #italic whom#!?"
 
 carnival.0012.d:0 "I did #bold what#!? In front of #italic everyone#!? Wearing nothing but a #S wig#!!?"
 
 carnival.0012.e:0 "Well... #italic Not that there's anything wrong with that#!..."
 
 carnival.0013.t:0 "Carnival: Irresponsible decisions"
 
 carnival.0013.desc:0 "Carnival is a time of song, dance, partying... And #italic spending#! as well, as I've learned the hard way. As the week passes and I find the holes in my pockets, I might as well learn a lesson or two from this improvidence, at least."
 
 carnival.0013.a:0 "I need to speak to my steward... Or my accountant..."
 
 carnival.0013.b:0 "I have already spent too much on my excesses. Time to donate some to charity!"
 
 carnival.0013.c:0 "Embrace the fame! Everyone, next round is on me!"
 
 carnival.0013.d:0 "So much gold spent on frivolous trinkets... I feel so guilty!"
 
 carnival.0013.e:0 "I'm so mad at this I might even #italic punch#! someone!"
 
 carnival.0014.t:0 "Carnival: Never again..."
 
 carnival.0014.desc:0 "Alcohol, banquets, reckless spending, immorality, profanity... That's not the life I want for me! This has been the last time I celebrate this sin-infested Carnival!"
 
 carnival.0014.a:0 "I have committed sin in the eyes of our faith. And my pockets."
 
 carnival.0014.b:0 "Only penitence will deliver my soul from this sinful life!"
 
 carnival.0014.c:0 "Fasting will cleanse my spirit!"
 
 carnival.0014.d:0 "I'm so ashamed I will never again leave my quarters!"
 
 carnival.0015.t:0 "Carnival: Party goes hard. Too hard..."
 
 carnival.0015.desc:0 "I can't remember much. It was dark, I was drunk. Someone was following me? Or maybe I was following someone...? I don't know. It's all a blur in my mind. But people saw it. #italic Many#! people. As I lay in bed and attempt to sober up, rumors already abound at court..."
 
 carnival.0015.a:0 "I just had a #bold massive #! hangover, but that's it..."
 
 carnival.0015.b:0 "That bar brawl turned into something very grave..."
 
 carnival.0015.c:0 "I may have taken that Brazilian manifesto #italic too#! literally..."
 
 carnival.0015.d:0 "They saw me taking part in strange rituals..."
