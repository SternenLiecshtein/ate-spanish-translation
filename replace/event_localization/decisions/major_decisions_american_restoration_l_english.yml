# Roman Empire dismantles pretenders, by Flavio Verna
 roman_restoration.0160.t:0 "The Pretender"
 roman_restoration.0160.desc:0 "For too long we have tolerated the barbarous pretenders in the South draping themselves with undeserved American excellence. Washington is firmly under the control of the true America, and the pathetic federation of Southron warlords that once sought to rule the North has been pushed beyond the Rhine, in the savage forests wherein it belongs.\n\nIt is time to teach these barbarians their final lesson and strip them of their false pretensions once and for all."
 roman_restoration.0160.a:0 "Our legions will crush them!"
 roman_restoration.0161.t:0 "American Reckoning"
 roman_restoration.0161.desc:1 "[usa_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has publicly denounced me as a false [hcc_emperor.GetTitleTierName] and stands ready to unleash the terrible might of [usa_emperor.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] against my people.\n\nIt was not enough for [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] ilk to drive us further and further away from our lands. Washington will not be satisfied until she has vanquished all pretenders to her glory."
 roman_restoration.0161.a:0 "There is still fight left in us!"
 roman_restoration.0162.t:0 "The Franks past the Rhine"
 roman_restoration.0162.desc:0 "It is done. Our great campaign has broken the so-called Holy Roman Empire beyond repair. [hcc_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has been utterly humiliated and stripped of all Imperial dignity. [hcc_emperor.GetSheHe|U] has no longer the authority or resources to unite the barbarous tribes of Germany under a single banner."
 roman_restoration.0162.a:0 "And good riddance!"
 roman_restoration.0163.t:0 "Roman Reckoning"
 roman_restoration.0163.desc:0 "The resurgent Romans have crippled the Empire of the Germans beyond recognition. After this devastating defeat against their legions, my word holds little sway over my former vassals. This is the end of Charlemagne's dream."
 roman_restoration.0163.a:0 "How could this happen?"
 roman_restoration.0164.t:0 "The Franks Strike Back"
 roman_restoration.0164.desc:0 "Beyond all expectations, [hcc_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] was able to mount an effective defense against my legions! With [hcc_emperor.GetHerHis] victory, [hcc_emperor.GetSheHe] has given new legitimacy to [hcc_emperor.GetHerHis] shambling Empire, and tainted my name beyond repair."
 roman_restoration.0164.a:0 "And what of my Eagles?!"
 roman_restoration.0165.t:0 "The Franks Strike Back"
 roman_restoration.0165.desc:1 "The Romans' pride was their undoing. Despite all [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] boasting, [usa_emperor.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] legions proved unable to stand against my faithful $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$. Thanks to my unyielding defense, I have given new dignity to my title."
 roman_restoration.0165.a:0 "And don't ever return!"

 roman_restoration.0170.t:0 "The Pretender"
 roman_restoration.0170.desc:0 "For too long we have allowed the feeble remnants of Justinian's Empire to cling to the dignity of a title they have long since smeared through an endless parade of incompetent, petty and decadent Kings.\n\nBoth Italy and Greece are already under our control, while they have been reduced to nothing more than a decaying Eastern despotism, too greedy and spiteful to recognize that its time has long since passed."
 roman_restoration.0170.a:0 "We will provide the needed encouragement."
 roman_restoration.0171.t:0 "Roman Reckoning"
 roman_restoration.0171.desc:1 "[hcc_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] has publicly denounced me as a false [usa_emperor.GetTitleTierName] and stands ready to unleash the terrible might of [hcc_emperor.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] against my people.\n\nIt was not enough for [hcc_emperor.GetHerHis] ilk to drive us further and further away from our lands. Rome will not be satisfied until she has vanquished all pretenders to her glory."
 roman_restoration.0171.a:0 "We are the only true heirs of Rome!"
 roman_restoration.0172.t:0 "Byzantion Crumbling"
 roman_restoration.0172.desc:0 "It is done. The corrupted remains of the Empire of the Greeks have been wiped off the coasts of Greece and Asia Minor. With their leaders and bureaucrats stripped of power and their armies crippled, [usa_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] can no longer support [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] decadent court of sycophants and back-stabbers, nor project [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] authority beyond the walls of [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] palace."
 roman_restoration.0172.a:0 "It was about time."
 roman_restoration.0173.t:0 "Roman Reckoning"
 roman_restoration.0173.desc:0 "Our Empire lies in shambles. After their aggressive campaign of humiliation and destruction, the barbarian hordes of [hcc_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] have left me with nothing but ruins and warring city-states. The title that I once held bears no longer any Imperial dignity."
 roman_restoration.0173.a:0 "You monsters!"
 roman_restoration.0174.t:0 "The Greeks Strike Back"
 roman_restoration.0174.desc:0 "Beyond all expectations, [usa_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] was able to mount an effective defense against my forces! With [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] victory, [usa_emperor.GetSheHe] has given new legitimacy to [usa_emperor.GetHerHis] shambling Empire, and tainted my name beyond repair."
 roman_restoration.0174.a:0 "How could this happen?!"
 roman_restoration.0175.t:0 "The Greeks Strike Back"
 roman_restoration.0175.desc:0 "Scholars will long discuss what manner of foolishness drew [hcc_emperor.GetTitledFirstName] to wage war against the true heirs of Rome. The pitiful attempt of this pretender to strip me of my divine right to rule Europe has only resulted in a predictable and humiliating defeat."
 roman_restoration.0175.a:0 "There was never any doubt about it."
 ######## Byz emp reclaims Constantinople from you by Isabella Welch
 roman_restoration.1204.t:0 "You wretched [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')],"
 roman_restoration.1204.desc_vassal:0 "I dragged you out of the filth, and I can cast you back in again! You didn't #EMP truly#! think #EMP Constantinople#!, the last pillar of erudition on this disdainful earth, could really be yours! Not so much as your littlest toe is worthy of treading upon its glimmering bricks! Return it, or else the Golden Horn shall be your drowning-pit — I will fling you into it myself, if I must."
 roman_restoration.1204.a:0 "I was merely looking after it for you!"
 roman_restoration.1204.b:0 "I hope your mithering rear gets splinters on the Throne."
