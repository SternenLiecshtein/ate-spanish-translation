 hold_comic_con_desc:0 "The Comic's Con was one of the greatest festivals of ancient times, and it still continues to this day. Thousands come to the city each year to participate in the festivities, which include performance entertainment, music, a large market of literary works, props and collector's items. But most famously, is the widespread pratice of cosplaying. Festival-goers dress themselves as mythical figures, folk heros and characters from works of fiction; books, plays and the like.
