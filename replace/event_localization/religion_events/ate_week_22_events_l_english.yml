modernist_art_week_22.2.t:0 "The 900th Anniversary of Independence"
modernist_art_week_22.2.desc:0 "All across Brazil, peasants and nobles alike have began the celebrations for the 900th anniversary of our independence from the distant Empire of Portugal. Farmers are preparing their harvest festivals, priests of all faiths are performing special services in honour of our land, and the knights and commanders rehearse their parades through our capitals. Meanwhile, the nobles organize their grand balls and the burghers and common folk decorate their homes and balconies with candles and flags. Surely this will be a week to remember!"
modernist_art_week_22.2.a:0 "Brasil! Campeão! Do mundo!"

modernist_art_week_22.3.t:0 "The Week of '22"
modernist_art_week_22.3.desc:0 "From the Amazon Delta to the coast of São Paulo, nobles and commoners joined their spirits in great celebrations in honour of Brazil - its people, its diversity and its freedom. Fortunately for some, unfortunately for others, however, this Carnival in the middle of the year must come to an end. Time to sober up, clean up the mess and return to work. One thing is certain, however: These were the festivities of a lifetime and scribes are already preparing their reports on the magnificent Week of '22!"
modernist_art_week_22.3.a:0 "A toast! To 900 more years!"

modernist_art_week_22.4.t:0 "The Week of '22 continues..."
modernist_art_week_22.4-Modernists.desc:0 "Weeks have passed, but the celebrations of the Week of '22 still persist across our territories. In some places, what began as a celebration to the spirit of the land, its past glories and its freedom, have swiftly turned into something resembling religious gatherings. The priests of our Modernist faiths have seized the opporunity to organize impromptu gatherings and services and present the works of the Old Masters to a very enthusiastic audience! Across Brazil, some even talk of a resurgence of the Modernists - or even a Revolution..."
modernist_art_week_22.4.desc:0 "This doesn't seem right... Weeks have passed, but the celebrations of the Week of '22 still persist across our territories. In some places, what began as a celebration to the spirit of the land, its past glories and its freedom, have swiftly turned into something resembling religious gatherings. Priests of the strange Modernist sects have taken the opportunity to organize impromptu gatherings and services, hoping to funnel this energy to their own nefarious objectives. However, some within my court have already taken to this movement and excitedly asked me to join them in these pagan celebrations!"
modernist_art_week_22.4.a:0 "Perhaps I should at least pay them a visit... What could possibly go wrong, huh?"
modernist_art_week_22.4.b:0 "Enough with this perversion! Send in the guards and disperse these crowds!"

modernist_art_week_22.5.t:0 "The Modernist Resurgence"
modernist_art_week_22.5-Modernists.desc:0 "Who could have imagined this? The celebrations of the Week of '22 have kickstarted a complex web of religious fervour and popular discontent all across Brazil, something unseen in these lands for centuries. From the Amazon to São Paulo, from the metropolises of the coast to the battered countryside, people are learning the history and the fundaments of the Modernist faiths. Saudosists, Macunaists, Architecturalists, Alternatives - we all agree this is a high point for our fellow believers! As we speak, preachers are spreading the teachings of the Old Masters to the masses in need of a new light - sacred hymns and visions from the Alternatives, and even philosophical musings and speeches from the Saudosists, Macunaists and Architecturalists. \n\nThe Week of '22 still holds another surprise for both us and the heathens, however: In some gatherings, preachers claim that a legendary Modernist holy text, frequently referenced by others but never before found in its original form, has been finally unearthed: the Anthropophagic Manifesto. The text, short and highly mystical, mentions many truths that are as dangerous as they are awe-inspiring. It reveals the True Law and explains the rites needed to unleash the full potential of mankind, while preaching an intense and clear revolt against those who try to contain their Revolution. Their main sacrament, Anthropophagy, is self-evident: one becomes more than themselves by consuming what’s not themselves..."

modernist_art_week_22.7.desc:0 "After several years of celebrations, the religious fervor that has spread across Brazil like a wildfire has finally sputtered out, and it seems the Week of '22 has finally come to an end. However, a sense of uncertainty still looms over the country. Will peace continue among the new converts? Or is this land destined to once again be engulfed in sectarian violence?"

modernist_art_week_22.8.desc:0 "The Week of '22 may have ended, but its effects still shock these lands. And, as any scholar knows, Revolutions are usually followed by periods of Reaction. Over the past weeks, the clergy of the traditional religions of Brazil have begun mass campaigns of conversion, in an attempt to regain those followers they have recently lost to the Modernist resurgence. These groups now approach our capital..."
