Aligning with either of these claimant's to Rome's legacy would greatly bolster our geopolitical standing, at the cost of handing the reins of our faith over to a foreign power. Alternatively, we could revive the ancient position of the Archdiocese of Boston, who shepherded the faithful through the storms of the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] before its subjugation and dissolution. Then again, the practices we have now have managed to keep our faith alive all these centuries - who is to say they must be altered? The choice is, ultimately, mine to make."
