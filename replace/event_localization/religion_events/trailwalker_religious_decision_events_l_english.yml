 aykayay.0201.t:0 "Branded By The Gods"
 aykayay.0201.desc.start:0 "Those who walk the Trails are just as subject to sin and vice as other men; but through the knowin' of the gods granted to Sacagawea and Lewison Clark, they have been taught the ways by which one may atone and purge the corruption from their souls.

 aykayay.0201.branding:0 "\n\n The brand which you shall recieve is one most commonly found on the flesh of Trailwalkers: the Barbed Barrier, the holy fence that keeps the realms apart and preserves the safety of the Range. \n\n Your Gunslinger, [court_chaplain.GetFirstName], takes a great iron and heats it within a high and bright fire, till it grows in color from dull rust to glimmering orange. Besides [court_chaplain.GetHerHim], assistants prepare five other striking irons; together, the six shall make upon your skin the mark of the Barbed Barrier."

 aykayay.0201.marked:0 "It burns, burns, burns!"
 aykayay.0201.stern.RrDrSs:0 "Let the iron stay long, long as Rattle-Mother's tail!"
 aykayay.0201.craven:0 "E-easy now; I'm sensitive back there!"
 aykayay.0201.flagellant:0 "I have never felt so close to the Frontier!"
 aykayay.0201.deviant:0 "MORE, MORE!"
