 ate_calvert_appeal.2.desc:0 "Rumors of trouble and rebellion are brewing in the Holy Columbian Commonwealth. A young minister has recently published a historical and religious text on an ancient province in Maryland, writing about a defining piece of their law, the 'Toleration Act' of Lord Calvert. Made to end conflict between Catholics and Evangelicals in the New World, this treaty put forth a law that promised safety and security for all of Christ's diverse faithful. The minister has compared this law to the ancient Constitution and its declaration of freedom of religion, and declared that this right should be given to the vassals of the Commonwealth. With the ideas of this appeal being spread throughout the Commonwealth via itinerant preachers, the ideas create serious questions about the moral authority of the Evangelical faith, and the Emperor is sure to act swiftly..."

Demanding freedom of religion, the text challenges the authority of the Emperor and the Council President of the Evangelical faith. Indeed, the Council President has already sent word asking for your help in combating this heresy.\n\nAlready the minister's ideas have begun to spread throughout the Commonwealth, and without swift action, many doctrines considered unorthodox may take hold..."

Gulping, the minister shakes his head defiantly. After being placed onto a block, his head is cut from his body. Your attention snaps to an angry noble, who shouts that the minister was under his protection. At the same time, a small group of peasants you recognize as Charismatic believers have rushed forward, attempting to dip bandanas in the ministers blood. No doubt they see him as a martyr. As the crowd becomes agitated, you see clearly that a show of force is required to reassert the authority of the Evangelical faith and your divine right as Emperor..."

The minister's death has seen the end of his ideas, but the Evangelical faith remains in danger of schism, something that can only be ended by the return of the Convention."

Whilst some are shocked by your treatment of a nobleman, your message gets across. Many nobles had supported the minister, considering his ideas an opportunity to expand their power, but that support has evaporated in the face of your threat of punishment. The nobles have now returned to their lands, and have increased their efforts to root out any remaining dissidence amongst the peasantry. The Evangelical faith has retained its authority."

Outraged at the man's treatment and the minister's execution, the nobility have begun to conspire amongst themselves. Many already supported the minister, and now as a martyr his words grant them a pretext to challenge your place as Emperor. The authority of the Evangelical faith is strongly in doubt, and the weak proclamations from Atlanta have little effect in swaying the rebellion..."

The move is shocking, going against the focus on liberty of belief that characterizes the Evangelical faith. As news of these actions spread across the commonwealth, more and more dissident preachers rise up and stir the peasantry into a frenzy. Calling on the 'Calvert Martyrs' to guide them, rebellions have broken out across the commonwealth. The Evangelical faith is in dire straits, with more and more abandoning it for new doctrines every day."

Furious at the minister, [emperor.GetTitledFirstName] ordered him executed. Rather than re-asserting his authority, however, the minister's death has inflamed the situation. Heretic creeds regard the minister as a martyr, and have begun pressing for civil war throughout the Commonwealth. The Evangelical faith is left crippled, unable to end the rapidly growing religious revivals throughout the Commonwealth."

Compared to the splendor of the ancient Church of the First Baptist, the minister's ragged threadbare gown appears inconsequential. However, you remain cautious. The minister has many supporters amongst the nobility, and his theology has already swayed many priests within the Commonwealth. Of course, debating his arguments aren't the only method you could use to end this crisis..."

Whilst you acknowledge some merit in his ideas, you explain to the minister that following the chaos of the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], order must come before individual liberty. Whilst reluctant, the minister acknowledges your position and publicly declares his support for your leadership and the Evangelical church.

However, he is clearly not up to the task, as the clergy under your guidance manage to pull apart his argument piece by piece.

Rather than either side making a conclusive case, the arguments stall as each side refuses to concede to the other. Whilst the clergy of the Evangelical faith manage to maintain face, many of the onlooking nobility become increasingly swayed by the minister's beliefs. The minister disappears at the end of the council. While his ideas are now publicly banned in the wake of the council, the dissidence has simply gone underground with more and more nobles swayed by his ideas.
