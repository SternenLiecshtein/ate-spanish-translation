As you breathe in her papaya-flavored breath, the trance of your passions is broken when you see her draw the shine of a dagger.\n\nYou escape completely naked from that terror, only to end up in the middle of the carnival street.

You put it in your mouth and chew.\n\nIt is bitter, as good medicine often is, and has a mealy texture as you swallow it, making sure that you have cleared all of it out from your mouth.

The Cedarperson anoints her with cedar-smoke before she leaves the Tipi.\n\nThe Roadman says four more prayers before the Water Woman returns with a pail of water. She is presented with the tobacco and smokes, saying one final prayer thanking the Great Spirit and praying for all the warriors in the land. She then addresses all the mothers and grandmothers of the community, thanking them for their sacrifices and teachings. Finally she takes a long smoke, and everyone thanks her.

One of the principal debates is on the importance of [shopping|E]. The Prophet spoke highly of the ritual, encouraging its use in order to appease [free_market|E]. Many sects, however, deny the spending of money as spiritually significant, instead promoting the accumulation of wealth as signifying spiritual power, while others promote their own methods by which one might invest themselves with the divine. Though each sect will likely still accept us as part of their spiritual marketplace, we will need to choose what our perspective on charity or hoarding is."
