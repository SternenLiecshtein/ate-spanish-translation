 ate_execution.0001.t: "The Grand Prismatic Spring"
 ate_execution.0001.desc_intro: "Deep inside the sacred lands of Yellowstone lies the Grand Prismatic Spring, an awe-inspiring body of perfectly blue, always-boiling water surrounded by rainbow-colored banks. It is a place of both intense beauty and errieness unlike anywhere else. No matter what time of year, those approaching the hotspring can glimpse steam rising up from the water like a gigantic boiling pot. All those wise to the ways of Yellowstone know to never draw close to the hotspring without excellent reason; while sunken wooden paths guide a visitor's path, a single careless slip can end one's life...or worse.\n\n"
 ate_execution.0001.desc_executioner: "I watch as nervous guards and my executioner, [executioner.GetShortUIName], march [recipient.GetShortUIName] ([recipient.GetHerHis] arms bound) along a short, creaking wooden pier built towards the spring's edge, where a lonesome stool has been placed. Reaching [recipient.GetHerHis] destination, [recipient.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is placed sitting on the stool, [recipient.GetHerHis] back to the water. From [recipient.GetHerHis] position, [recipient.GetSheHe] can see me and my small entourage at a safe distance away from the shoreline. Solemnly, the guards gesture towards me and I give a decisive motion in return: This is the end.\n\nWith the final signal granted, [executioner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] turns to face [recipient.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] before kicking [recipient.GetHerHim] off the stool and into the waters behind [recipient.GetHerHim]. The screaming is instantaneous and inhuman. With [recipient.GetHerHis] arms bound behind them, all [recipient.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can do is trash and roar helplessly like a wild, panicked animal. Although in reality the time until the end of the wailing is short, for those present it feels like an eternity.\n\n"

 ate_execution.0001.desc_ending: "Nothing in [actor.GetFaith.CreatorNamePossessive] creation is as brutally absolute as the Grand Prismatic Spring. By tomorrow there will be no trace of [recipient.GetNameNoTooltip], none whatsoever, left on Earth; without exception the Grand Prismatic Spring devourers all living things completely and utterly. It will, with breakneck speed, split the corpse into pieces and dissolve them, never ever to be seen again. "

 # Niagara Falls and Iguazu Falls
 
 ate_execution.0101.t: "Iguazu Falls"
 ate_execution.0101.desc_intro: "Deep within the sun-baked lands along the Iguazu River lies a natural marvel of unparalleled power and menace - a place where nature’s beauty collides with its merciless force: Iguazu Falls. Here, towering sheets of water plunge relentlessly over the cliffs, thundering into a churning cauldron of mist and froth below. The sight is magnificent and terrifying, a testament to nature’s raw, uncontainable energy. All year long a perpetual veil of mist rises from the base, creating rainbows that dance in the sunlight which produces a deceptive calm that hides the furious torrent below. All who know Iguazu’s waters understand never to stray too close; even a single misstep on the slick, wet rocks could prove fatal.\n\n"
