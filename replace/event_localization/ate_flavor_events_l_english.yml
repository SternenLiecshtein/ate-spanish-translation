 # Metis Red River Flavour

 red_river_collapse.1.desc:0 "The Rivyayr Roozh Kingdom was developed out of a time of crisis and religious fervor. As various Hetmans consolidated control over the Canadian Plains, the Metis followers of Riel were among the first to suffer.\n\nThe Infallible Pontiff in Winnipeg, with enemies at the gates, called upon the faithful to protect the New Rome. However, when Jarema the Old conquered northern and western Manitoba with his praire hordes and declared himself Hetman, devoted Metis knights and nobles built a new foundation on the legacy of Riel's Red River Rebellion.\n\nThrough many centuries of defense and blood, Winnipeg has stood free, but her foremost defender has been subjagated. Should these new rulers not wish to carry on the task of protecting the Infallible Pontiff, they will surely cast the Rivyayr Roozh Kingdom to the dustbin of history."

Our first step in completing Riel's dream of a united North America has been achieved, and it will be under a Manitoban flag that our armies march with from now on."
