The knots in my shoulders confirm another night spent pouring over ledgers and correspondence, and I groan at the thought of the council meeting I have in just a few hours.\n\nStretching, I reach for a small bell and ring it. After what feels like hours, a servant steps through the door with a tray and a large mug of coffee.\n\nDowning the hot liquid, I feel the aches in my head and shoulders dull, my vision becoming clearer as the fatigue in my body lifts. Sighing with contentment, I signal for the servant to follow me with more coffee at the ready, as I prepare to meet the day, ever more grateful of the brew that helps me keep on pushing through at all hours of the day and night..."
