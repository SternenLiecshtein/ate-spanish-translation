 game_concept_joe_feraille_desc: "Joe Féraille, also known as Iron Joe and Beausoleil, is the Voodoo saint and lwa of warfare. Joe Féraille is a cunning, mischievous mercenary. Although a relentless warrior who is quick to help those petition him, Joe Féraille can easily trick those who are more gullible or unwilling to uphold their end of the bargain. Joe Féraille is respected and feared, as it is known that Iron Joe will always have the upper hand whether it be in fighting or in wits."

 game_concept_first_ruination: "First Ruination"
 game_concept_first_ruination_desc: "The First Ruination is the broad term that various Atlantean faiths use to refer to the fall of the first precursor civilization, usually Atlantis or a derivative of it, which happened long before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], which is often called the 'Second Ruination'."
 
 #Quetzalcoatl
 game_concept_chicomoztoc: "Chicomóztoc"
 game_concept_chicomoztoc_desc: "Chicomóztoc, also known as Agartha or the Place of Seven Caves, is the subterranean kingdom where each of the Root Races, including the [Concept('q_fifth_sun','fifth iteration')|E], the people of [aztlan|E], originated from and eventually left. The Order of Quetzalcoatl has attempted for generations to uncover its location, but to no avail. It is believed that Chicomóztoc is still inhabited by the Sixth Root Race, which must be first freed in order to continue the ongoing evolution of the seven Root Races."
 
 game_concept_aztlan: "Aztlán"
 game_concept_aztlan_desc: "The Aztec people settled the island of Aztlán, also known as Atlantis, creating the greatest and most advanced civilization in history, a world-spanning empire known for its great works of literature. The glory of the island was cut short by a [Concept('first_ruination','great flood')|E], which destroyed and submerged the remains of Aztlán. Their God-King Quetzalcóatl survived, fleeing across the waves with his subjects until reaching Lake Texcoco, where they saw an eagle devouring a snake while perched on a cactus, where he would found the city of Tenochtitlán, the capital of the Aztec Empire."
 
 game_concept_toltecayotl: "Toltecayotl"
 game_concept_toltecayotl_desc: "Toltecáyotl, the Way of the Artisans, was the original form of Freemasonry as created by Quetzalcóatl. The Toltecs, an elite class of ancient philosophers, preserved the spiritual and scientific knowledge of [aztlan|E], allowing for the Olmec, Maya, and Aztec civilizations to flourish. However, the Aztec Empire abandoned the principles of the Toltecs and the knowledge inherited from Aztlán. The warrior Cortés, disguised as a returning Quetzalcóatl, destroyed and defeated the Aztec Empire, being able to do so due to ancient Atlantean knowledge having been forgotten. However, the hidden faithful Toltecs continued to pass down the traditions within their lodges, eventually coalescing into the Order of Quetzalcóatl."

 game_concept_q_fifth_sun: "The End of the Fifth Sun"
 game_concept_q_fifth_sun_desc: "During the era of the Fifth Sun, Huitzilopochtli was the Aztec god of war who had been bestowed the title of Sun God by Quetzalcóatl so that he could rule over the skies that witnessed the founding of Tenochtitlán and the rise of the Aztec Empire. After the Aztecs strayed from [toltecayotl|E], the Fifth Sun came to an early end when the weakened Huitzilopochtli was ritually murdered by Mictlantecuhtli for allowing the Aztecs to lose the secrets of Freemasonry. The death god then stole humanity into Mictlán, where he intended to keep them forever to break the cycles of the Sun Gods. However, this catastrophe was averted when Quetzalcóatl entered Mictlán and slew Mictlantecuhtli for his crime, before returning humanity to the surface and becoming the Sixth Sun God, where he reigns to this day."

 #Idiosyncratic

 game_concept_cosmic_destiny: "Cosmic Destiny"
 game_concept_cosmic_destiny_desc: "Cosmic Destiny is hope for the future and reverence of the past. It is the dreams and memories of the Mexican people as imagined within the theologies of the various Idiosyncratic faiths. However, the envisioned meaning of Cosmic Destiny is inherently malleable, and thus, it is interpreted in many ways. Some view it as a call to action for liberty. Others view it as an assertion of order against a tumultuous world. One shared element of the Cosmic Destiny is that it, directly or tangentially, involves [cosmos|E]. No matter the specifics, the Cosmic Destiny is the central element which any Idiosyncratic faith bases its worldview around."

 game_concept_cosmos: "Cosmos"
 game_concept_cosmos_desc: "Like the [Concept('cosmic_destiny','Destiny')|E] which takes its name from Cosmos, the entity itself is subject to an extremely diverse set of interpretations. Some consider Cosmos a god, others a force, even a law of nature. Still more hate Cosmos, love it, or are indifferent to the entity, viewing it as trivial compared to more actionable causes. Cosmos is however, inextricably tied to the development of the Mexican people, and Cosmos is always viewed as the ultimate source of Mexico. Due to the entity’s generalized power and influence, this connection to the figure is viewed as the reason for which it is considered necessary to focus single mindedly on achieving Cosmic Destiny."

 game_concept_cosmic_heroes: "Cosmic Heroes"
 game_concept_cosmic_heroes_desc: "Cosmic Heroes are the various revered figures, which have been blessed by or taken in the energies and powers of [cosmos|E]. Often these figures play a large role in the pursuit of the [cosmic_destiny|E]. The number, details, and identities of these figures can vary, as well as whether new individuals or gods are able to become Cosmic Heroes. Respect is common, however the degree to which emulation, devotion, and theological analysis occurs depends heavily on the specific hero and sect itself. Some Idiosyncratics do not even concern themselves with Cosmic Heroes, often favoring Cosmos or other forces as central entities within their canon."

 game_concept_enigmas: "Enigmas"
 game_concept_enigmas_desc: "The Enigmas are the snippets of lost knowledge which the Enigmáticos search tirelessly for. The nature and form of these Enigmas vary: a scrap of a book, a piece of an ancient war vehicle, a large carved slab of rock, an Enigma can be anything. Any lost clue to the greater machinations of the pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Gran Apagón')|E] world is a treasured insight, however, those are few and far between after the centuries since the Event. More likely, an Enigma will take the form of writings or documentation of the Event from a more recent source. The point is less the form that the information takes, but rather the fact that any artifact can and will assist the Enigmáticos’ quest to once again imprison [cosmos|E] and bring progress and prosperity back to Mexico."

 game_concept_mexico_city_smackdown: "The Mexico City Smackdown"
 game_concept_mexico_city_smackdown_desc: "Legends tell of the immediate chaos of post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] Mexico City, where the battles between three different Idiosyncratic factions raged for hundreds of years, engulfing the entire region in a forever-war which was only broken by the restoration of the Catholic Church. Of these, the eventual victors were the Alineados, who bested both the dissident Auditoristas and the Hexagonal luchadores to become the majority belief system of the area, even if they could not hold onto power after taking it. While the actual agreed upon facts are few, the conflict’s legacy has led to a deep resentment between Hexagonales and the rest of the Idiosyncratic faiths in particular, as the luchadores view their defeat in the Smackdown as being caused by vague duplicity and rule breaking on the part of their enemies. Additionally, the shame of being defeated by groups they deem to be weaklings must certainly play some role."

 #animist

 game_concept_animas: "Ánimas"
 game_concept_animas_desc: "The veneration of souls, or "Ánimas," of the tragically departed is central to animist spirituality, primarily through the construction and maintenance of "Ánimitas," small shrines used to remember and honor these souls. They believe these souls, with their unfulfilled lives, bridge the mortal and divine realms, enabling them to intercede and cause miracles. While most shrines are dedicated to local souls, some Ánimas have gained large followings and are regarded as saintly spirits willing to help the faithful across the land."

 game_concept_schism2578: "Great Schism of 2578"
 game_concept_schism2578_desc: "The Great Schism of 2578 was a significant division within Latin American Christianity, resulting in the formation of two major branches: the Episcopal Catholic Church and the Particular Church. This schism was primarily driven by disputes over patriarchal authority, theological disagreements, and cultural-religious differences, such as divergent views on the veneration of [animas|E] and religious scholarship.\n\nThe Kingdom of Paraguay aligned itself with the Particular Church, while the western Catholic polities such as Neuquén and Chile lent their support to the Episcopal Catholic Church."

Just as the Father and Son make up the male trinity within the Quinternity, the Mother and Daughter make up the female trinity, with the Holy Spirit uniting both. On earth, the Daughter continually returns to act as the perpetual leader of the faith by sharing the truth of Her various new revelations."

 game_concept_battle_for_earth_desc: "A defining moment in the [war_of_the_worlds_zetan|E], the [annunaki_zetan|E] struck a crushing blow against humanity. They did this by first infiltrating the planet, before creating an oppressive Deep-State which deceived humanity, distracting them from their true attack. Their real goal was to use a base hidden within the Moon to shift the Earth-Poles which kept the globe in psychic balance. By doing this, civilization began to collapse, until humanity realized the deception and rallied their [Concept('council_of_arcturia','allies')|E]. This confrontation was devastating, but the Annunaki were repelled in the end, though at great cost to all parties. In the fallout of the battle, mankind's allies were forced to evacuate the planet of all permanent bases, and both sides have since [Concept('the_event_ate','been greatly weakened')|E]."
 
 game_concept_annunaki_zetan: "Annunaki"
 game_concept_annunaki_zetan_desc: "The Annunaki are humanity's original creator and greatest enemy. Ruling from the tenth planet of the Solar System, Niburu, the Annunaki possess a vast and sprawling space empire, which they maintain with ruthless cruelty. However, due to the weak physical bodies of these ancient astronauts, they require countless servile creatures. By splicing their blood with that of apes, they were able to create the first humans on Earth. They then left the planet for millions of years, to let their creations prepare it for settlement and extract its resources for the Annunaki. However, the final step of this plan was the extermination of all humans, as they had served their purpose. This was resisted, leading to the [council_of_arcturia|E], and the beginning of the [war_of_the_worlds_zetan|E]."

 game_concept_council_of_arcturia: "Council of Arcturia"
 game_concept_council_of_arcturia_desc: "This galactic council and treaty of the same name was the moment where various aliens, including the [zeta_reticulans|E], allied together to fight off the [annunaki_zetan|E] threat. Organized by humanity, represented by the [majestic_twelve_zetan|E], the Council of Arcturia is a landmark in intergalactic diplomacy, and a shared bond that, while weakened by the [battle_for_earth|E], remains strong to this day. The council gets its name from the planet it was hosted on, home of the Arcturians.\n\nThe Arcturians are renowned psychic healers, and one of the most steadfast protectors of Earth. Before the [war_of_the_worlds_zetan|E], they used their unique nature as star-beings, made only of pure light to travel the cosmos, acting as space physicians by healing planets and their populations, while asking nothing in return. The Arcturians had been attacked and provoked numerous times by the Annunaki due to their kindness, but never resorted to violence until the Majestic Twelve revealed the full extent of the Annunaki's evil."

 game_concept_war_of_the_worlds_zetan: "War of the Worlds"
 game_concept_war_of_the_worlds_zetan_desc: "The War of the Worlds is the sprawling and ongoing conflict between the [council_of_arcturia|E] and the [annunaki_zetan|E]. Once waged using advanced chariots and ships, now it has primarily become a psychic conflict due to the devastation inflicted on both sides of the [battle_for_earth|E]. One unintended effect of the long war is the appearance of [little_green_men_zetan|E] on Earth. Scars from this War are countless, from the Destruction of Pluto to the Slaughter of the Skyfish, there seems to be no end in sight for its carnage."

 game_concept_zeta_reticulans: "Zeta-Reticulans"
 game_concept_zeta_reticulans_desc: "Humanity's greatest ally, the Zeta-Reticulans are gray skinned aliens from Zeta Reticuli. Conquered by the [annunaki_zetan|E], the Zetans were vassals for a time, often conducting science expeditions and surveillance on behalf of their masters. This eventually allowed to make contact with humanity using their flying saucers, which they would go on to use to transport the [majestic_twelve_zetan|E] to the [council_of_arcturia|E].\n\nSince the [battle_for_earth|E], they have been unable to keep permanent bases on Earth, only conducting fly-bys in their ships and making occasional forms of non-psychic contact. Due to these being the first cosmic beings that humanity met, and in honor of the alliance between man and gray, all study and interactions with extraterrestrials are referred to as "Zetanology" by Zetanologists."

 game_concept_little_green_men_zetan: "Little Green Men"
 game_concept_little_green_men_zetan_desc: "Little Green Men is a catch-all term used for the diverse alien opportunists which have visited Earth to benefit from its current weakened state since its [Concept('the_event_ate','devastation')|E]. The name comes from the physical description of the most common visitor, the Andromedans.\n\nThe Andromedans, as a civilization of nomads, can often cause annoyance or inconvenience, due to their mischievous nature, but are ultimately harmless. This is true for most beings which end up falling within the category of "Little Green Man.""

 game_concept_majestic_twelve_zetan_desc: "The Majestic Twelve were a group of twelve members of the Men in Black who betrayed their [annunaki_zetan|E] masters and the Deep State in order to inform the galactic community about the extensive crimes and evils done by their creators. They were transported to the [council_of_arcturia|E] by the [zeta_reticulans|E] in flying saucers, where they successfully gathered allies for humanity, thereby starting the [war_of_the_worlds_zetan|E]. Their fate and true identities are unknown and hotly contested among experts in Zetanology."

#camino estrelar

 game_concept_viracocha_camino_estelar_desc: "To those of the Star Path, Viracocha is an extraterrestrial king who brought his court to Earth in order to share his people's advanced technology, wise laws, and profound music with humanity. While some others are confused, mistaking him for a god and his courtiers for angels, the Camino-estrellas know better. Rather, Viracocha was a mortal being, though one beyond current human understanding. Since ordering the construction of Tiwanaku, ruling the Incan Empire, and then departing back for the stars, it is unknown exactly what he is doing now. Despite this, those on the Star Path have faith that the Cosmic Lord will give them a sign and one day return."

 game_concept_wilkamayu_camino_estelar: "Wilka Mayu"
 game_concept_wilkamayu_camino_estelar_desc: "The Wilka Mayu, or Sacred River, is the traditional term used to for the Milky Way within Andean astrological study. Mirrored by the Wilkamayu River flowing down from Cunurana, a great deal of importance was once placed upon both its celestial and terrestrial forms for the value they provided Incan civilization. Those on the Star Path still use the course it weaves among the stars to decipher the meaning of the cosmos to this day, seeing it as both a place to dream of one day reaching and a template to emulate on Earth."

#Cao Dai

 game_concept_great_struggle_cao_dai_desc: "A legendary conflict that engulfed the lost homeland of Cao Đài, the Great Struggle is believed to have marked the beginning of the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E]. A brutal sectarian war that saw large scale occupation by foreign kings, it resulted in the followers of the Ancestral Holy See being scattered across the world. Stories of screaming birds belching shimmering flames across the land, apocalyptic judgment and desolation, it was the end of paradise. Some even suggest it resulted in the complete destruction of the homeland, though no one knows for certain. Regardless, it forms a core pillar of post-Event Cao Đài identity."

#Hutterite
game_concept_colonies_hutterite: "Colonies"
game_concept_colonies_hutterite_desc: "As the Hutterites moved from Central Europe, to Russia, and finally to the United States and Canada, fleeing persecution and discrimination with each journey, they have almost entirely kept to the colony system. Every colony is largely rural and agricultural in nature, holding all land in common and sharing community products as a collective rather than using wages. Due to each colony running itself without interconnected leadership, the governance structures of individual colonies have diverged and evolved, but tend to maintain a two tiered system of a higher council and a common electorate composed of married men. However, the prevalence of hereditary rule across the Americas has made the colony system far more open to compromise."

#Kanadeva

 game_concept_upnehimacharya: "Upnehimacharya"
 game_concept_upnehimacharya_desc: "An Avatar of Lord Shiva, the Kanadevan sect would not exist, were it not for the great wisdom of Upnehimacharya. A pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] sage and mystic, Upnehima channeled the power of [atom_kanadevan|E] to achieve countless heroic feats and benefits to humanity. Chief among them was revealing the potential to comprehend the attributeless nature of Brahman by splitting an Atom. Though most human beings are unable to understand this, and therefore must worship gods like Lord Shiva and others as intermediaries of Brahman. This underlying truth taught by Upnehimacharya acts as the basis for all deeper Kanadevan theological study and esoteric exploration."

 game_concept_maya_kanadevan: "Maya"
 game_concept_maya_kanadevan_desc: "Maya, often called Background Radiation due to its interference with true insight, is the misunderstanding inherent to the nature of humankind's perception of reality. Sometimes compared to an illusion or deception, it is much closer to an incorrect theoretical understanding of the properties of the universe. By working to attain knowledge beyond this faulty perspective, eventually a human can split an [Concept('atom_kanadevan','Atom')|E], beginning them on the path to attaining Moksha by observing its unobstructed form."

 game_concept_atom_kanadevan: "Atoms"
 game_concept_atom_kanadevan_desc: "Atoms, or more accurately, the underlying singular Atom that only appears divided to human perception, is the Soul which everything within reality possesses. Unified with Brahman, Atoms constitute everything in the universe. The study of their nature and the ultimate goal of splitting one to observe its true form is of primary importance to Kanadevan scholarship. It is also believed that various powers and feats of supernatural ability or achievement, both physical and spiritual, can be attained after splitting an Atom. These gifts were once used extensively, first demonstrated by [upnehimacharya|E], in powering flying cities and creating endless energy before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E]. This knowledge has since been lost, reduced to only a few scraps and meager remnants, a tragedy beyond compare."

#Vanguardia

 game_concept_progress_vanguardia_desc: "Joyful and free, Progress is love, charity, and happiness distilled into its most pure form. It is the force begging the hearts of men, urging them to embrace what they know in their hearts to be true. It brings wisdom, prosperity, and beauty. Served by the [great_progressors_vanguardia|E], the way to bring Progress to the forefront of society is hotly debated by scholars within Vanguardia society."

 game_concept_regression_vanguardia: "Regression"
 game_concept_regression_vanguardia_desc: "Caustic and hateful, Regression is fear, greed, and cruelty distilled into its most pure form. It is the force pulling on the hearts of mankind, urging them to reject what they know in their hearts to be true. It breeds violence, oppression, war, and stagnation. Served by Caudillos, the only way to ever defeat Regression is by exposing it to beauty and love, art in its purest forms."

 game_concept_great_progressors_vanguardia: "Great Progressors"
 game_concept_great_progressors_vanguardia_desc: "While figures like Darío, Martí, Sandino are universally agreed to be Great Progressors, the full canon of figures is always shifting, debated and scrutinized constantly. A pious poet may find themselves upheld as a Great Progress during their lifetime, but after their death, they may be decried as a Caudillo and held in contempt. The reverse is just as common, for those at the forefront of Progress are constantly trying to find the true way to destroy [regression_vanguardia|E] once and for all, something that is surely to be found soon..."

 game_concept_eureka: "Eureka"
 game_concept_eureka_desc: "Eureka is a term that encapsulates the state of enlightenment. To attain Eureka is to do more than just realize the ultimate truth of being.

 game_concept_golden_garden: "Golden Garden"
 game_concept_golden_garden_desc: "The Golden Gardens are purified realms of the universe, created through the cultivation of good karma. These gardens are havens from ignorance and suffering, and are the very source of enlightenment. They dot the night sky, shining as stars to guide humanity. While the Earth is a broken land of suffering, it is possible to cultivate a Golden Garden on Earth for the salvation of all beings. As above, so below. That which has been, will return again. As in Heaven, so on Earth."

 game_concept_the_machine: "The Machine"
 game_concept_the_machine_desc: "While it goes by many names, such as the Man, the Combine, Babylon, Big Brother, Moloch, the Establishment, the Bohemian Club, the Feds, and countless more, the concept these terms seek to describe is most often referred to as simply “the Machine”.\n\nA spiritual, political, and metaphysical force that is often invisible to direct scrutiny, those who believe it to exist can identify its indirect influence within many of the temporal institutions on Earth. The Machine manifests itself as oppression, inequality, hatred, censorship, and tyranny, and uses systems of human governance as its primary method to corrupt the physical world and therefore prevent humanity from advancing its consciousness towards [eureka|E]. Only by opposing and destroying the servants of the Machine, be they aware of their service or not, can there be any successful application of the Eternal Living Vanguard’s theory."

 game_concept_yin_and_yang_guruist: "Yin and Yang"
 game_concept_yin_and_yang_guruist_desc: "A duality of evil and good, dark and light, inaction and action, female and male, the concepts of Yin and Yang represent many opposed, but complementary forces which reside within a person. By achieving balance between the two forces, an individual is able to unlock many psychic and spiritual powers, as finding this balance is believed to be the path to [eureka|E]."

 game_concept_lifeless_night_desc: "Both a term used to describe a [Concept('the_event_ate','nearly forgotten cataclysm')|E] and death itself, the Lifeless Night is what awaits every living thing. It is the inevitable eternal darkness that all things one day face. While it is a final end, it need not be painful. To make sure that souls are able to sleep peacefully, carved totems known as "seeds" are made from bone in order to comfort the spirits of the departed, so that they do not return as suffering draugr to haunt the living. Many of these can be found stored away in the [GetBuilding('seedvault').GetName], though mainly in the upper chambers."

 game_concept_naturalism_constructivist_desc: "The Natural Dogma is the primary enemy of Constructivism, it is considered the cult of imitation, a formless doctrine that denies the existence of all higher meaning. Naturalists might not always know the cause which they serve, but all those who seek to reduce the world to a series of meaningless surfaces and sensations are its agents."

 game_concept_dharmapalas_desc: "A Dharmapala, or "Dharma Protector" is a Buddhist term typically used to a refer to fearsome supernatural beings tasked with the defense of the teachings of Dharma. They are divided into two categories: the worldly guardians called "lokapalas" who uphold the natural order, often by protecting monasteries or sacred locations on Earth, and the astral "jnanapala", who will play a crucial role in the return of Maitreya.\n\nDevoted spirit-warriors pursue their sacred duty by cultivating themselves towards a state of Exaltation, an achievement which will allow them to join Maitreya in his Celestial Kingdom of Shambhala and become a Dharmapala. After the prophesized restoration of the Dharma by Maitreya and his heavenly army, the jnanapalas among them will establish their own Celestial Kingdoms across the universe. They will then preserve knowledge of the Dharma through these new realms and take in any mortal who calls upon their power as a Spirit Child."
