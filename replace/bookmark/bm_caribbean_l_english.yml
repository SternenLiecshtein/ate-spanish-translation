#  bm_caribbean:0 "Mar de Caníbales"
#  bm_caribbean_desc:0 "Durante siglos, el equilibrio de poder en las Antillas fue dominado por dos reinos poderosos: Cuba e Hispaniola. Sin embargo, con una rebelión de campesinos en Cuba desafiando el dominio incuestionable de la casa Buenavista y las intrigas dinásticas en la isla de Hispaniola dividiendo el viejo reino por la mitad, el viejo orden ha caído presa de señores en guerra y piratas intrépidos.\n\nNadando en aguas turbulentas, la situación ha sido aprovechada por la joven conquistadora Portia Seacole, quien ha expandido rápidamente su dominio sobre las islas. Solo el tiempo dirá si el viejo orden será restaurado o si una nuevo poder se alzará sobre el mar de caníbales."
