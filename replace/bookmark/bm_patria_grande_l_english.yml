#  bm_patria_grande:0 "Six Hundred Years of Solitude"
#  bm_patria_grande_desc:0 "For a brief moment it seemed like the Gran Colombia of old would be united once more, that moment ended more than a century ago, but its scars still mark the land. The faith that united the nation still dominates the hearts of its people, while strange heresies have appeared in its outskirts, and the blood of the heirs to the imperial throne has yet to die.\n\nTo the east, in the lands of old Venezuela, the faith of the land never arrived. The Caribbean still prays to its old gods, too numerous for anybody to know all their names. And in the plains, men who lives among horse worship names of horror that outsiders would only whispers.\n\nWith the land fractured in a hundred little reals, it seems like uniting the Fatherland is nothing but a pipedream, but perhaps a land doomed to six hundred years of solitude will see her second life on Earth."

#  ### CHARACTERS

# bookmark_patria_zac_patria:0 "Zacarías, the last caudillo"
# bookmark_patria_zac_patria_desc:0 "Zacarías Alvarado is the heir to a glorious line, to the title of patriarch of the faithful, to the imperial throne of Colombia. And yet, over the generations the possessions of his house have been reduced to a few lands near the old imperial capital. As the last caudillo of the line of the Falso Libertador enters his final years, the future of the dynasty and the faith seems darker than ever.\n\nCan the House of Alvarado return to its imperial glory or is this truly the autumn of the patriarchs?"

# bookmark_patria_panama:0 "Miguel the Usurper"
# bookmark_patria_panama_desc:0 "Perfidious rumors have surrounded the king his entire life, some say that his relationship with the late king Zacarías was more than platonic, some others that it was his hand that took the old monarch’s life or even that he usurped the throne by trickery and deception. Ultimately, none of these lies matter to the king, for his is the hand that controls the lands that unite the North and the South.\n\nWill the king keep his good name and bring a prosperous rule for Panamá, or will his past finally catch up to him?"

# bookmark_patria_chiriqui:0 "Bendición, Infanta de Panamá"
# bookmark_patria_chiriqui_desc:0 "A heavy weight was placed on Bendición at a very tender age. Rumors of his uncle’s murder by a treacherous lover, of the usurpation of a throne that was rightfully hers, of conspiracies against her life and of secret toast made in her honor. It’s a tragedy when a girl loses her childhood and is forced into a dangerous game, but as the most powerful heiress of the imperial family, she may be forced to learn the rules of the game very fast.\n\nWill the princess regain her family’s honor or should her supporters just wish good night to the sweet princess?"

# bookmark_patria_macondo:0 "Buendia Arcadio"
# bookmark_patria_macondo_desc:0 "There is no long and proud history to Macondo, land named after the dream city of the sacred texts. It was founded just a generation ago by men tired of the tyranny of kings. The resulting republic only survives thanks to a delicate balance of power among men of different faiths and conflicting interests. Macondo is a volatile land, but one thing is true, its men bow to no king.\n\nWill Arcadio secure his republic’s future or will it be remembered as just a fleeting political experiment?"

# bookmark_patria_zulia:0 "Oneida Santos"
# bookmark_patria_zulia_desc:0 "Oneida is the sole defender of the faith, as was her mother and her mother before her. To the west she is flanked by dubious heretics who insist on putting a crucified prophet over the sacred land itself, to the east are superstitious pagans worshiping a crowd of fake gods, and to the south the savages of the plains pray to the devil itself. But the queen fears not, because the desert protects her, like only a mother can.\n\nWill Oneida save her ancestral land or will the Queendom be lost in the sands of time?"
