 #### Ghosts of the North
  bm_ghost_of_the_north:0 "Ghosts of the North"
  bm_ghost_of_the_north_desc:0 "The North is an old land, full of memories and ghosts. The once-proud kingdoms of Quebec and Ontario have fallen, laid low not by outsiders, but by threats and betrayal from within. The Lords of Hudsonia witnessed the fall, and fear a similar doom. Their King is a pale reflection of the dead Clintons, and each suspects the other of working to take the throne. Likewise, the Queen of the Maritimes rules her lands with an iron fist, brooking no internal discord - and yet, she sees her people diminish year by year, beset by raiders and worse. \n\nIn keeps and courts along the Saint Laurent, ambitious dukes and counts scheme and plot to reclaim their fallen kingdoms, a breakout sect of tolerant pacifists has brought a moment of calm to troubled lands in Ontario, and in New York, powerful monied interests aim to build their fortunes, capitalizing upon the coming wars. But, unknown to them all, in Boston, a dreamer has visions of a once and future kingdom, and on the shores of Lake Huron a young man has sworn oaths of blood and revenge, threatening to upend the entire affair."

If Baltus can ride the storm and restore Hudsonia to its old strength, he will be remembered as the equal of those that came before.

His domain is far from impressive, and his name is hardly known, but maybe one day that will change."

  bm_patria_grande_desc:0 "For a brief moment, it seemed like the Gran Colombia of old would be united once more. While that moment ended more than a century ago, its scars still mark the land. The faith that united the nation still dominates the hearts of its people, while strange heresies have appeared in its outskirts, and the blood of the heirs to the imperial throne has yet to die.\n\nTo the east, in the lands of old Venezuela, the faith of the land never arrived. The Caribbean still prays to its old gods, too numerous for anybody to know all their names. And in the plains, men who live among horses worship names of horror that outsiders would only whisper.\n\nWith the land fractured into a hundred little realms, it seems like uniting the Fatherland is nothing but a pipedream, but perhaps a land doomed to six hundred years of solitude will see her second life on Earth."
