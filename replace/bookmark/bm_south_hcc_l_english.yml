#  bm_south_hcc_desc:0 "When Leonidas Royall and his brotherhood of brave companions forged the Holy Columbian Commonwealth from the shards of the kingdoms of the old south, it is doubtful that he could have anticipated what it is today. From the shadowed hollows and coves of the Blue Ridge mountains to gator country in the south, from the meandering rivers of the west to the bustling urban centers on the coast, the HCC is a bastion of stability, wealth, and prestige. Knights in service to noble lords participate  in colorful jousts at country fairs, and perform brave deeds in service to God. Gold flows from traders hailing from the great cities of the north and south, east and west, towards the shining imperial capital of Atlanta, benefiting all. Truly, the Holy Columbian Commonwealth is the inheritor to Old America! \n\n But there is fear that not all is well. Increasingly loud whispers claim this is but a shining facade, a tapestry draped over a crumbling system. In the west, the Mississippian marches have broken away, united in opposition to the HCC, in the Appalachians, the lord of Asheville openly defies the Empire, and in Florida, tribals chieftains, feudal lords, and patricians alike conspire to seize even a fraction of the vast wealth flowing into the HCC. Within the empire, some fear corruption and stagnation has eroded the bedrock of civilized society, as the Evangelical Council has become more a political entity than one dedicated to leading the flock, and imperial electors spend more time in the capital scheming and squabbling over access to the imperial throne than caring for their own lands at home.  \n\n It takes much to fell such a behemoth, and a strong emperor may still right the ship, but is Julius Gee that emperor?"
