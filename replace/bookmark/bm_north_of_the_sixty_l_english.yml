#  bm_north_of_the_sixty_desc:0 "This is the place where the great myth of the frontier reached its apogee, and met its end. Where an ancient native cultural tapestry intersects with the ancient migrations from the south and east. A land of massive lakes and rivers, rolling hills, impassable and implacable mountains, and nigh-endless flats, where animal migrations dictate the flow of life. Cultures and faiths mingle here, as harsh natural conditions, short growing seasons and ephemeral bounties force all people into common, shared modes of living. Christianity, in many forms, finds new champions, while the folklore of a rough land continues to enchant many people, who recognize few powers greater than the Midnight Sun."
#  ### CHARACTERS

#  bookmark_nots_greenland:0 "King Agsile"
#  bookmark_nots_greenland_desc:0 "Agsile is the young king of Greenland, new and untempered by the hardships of rule. While he has a strong sense of duty and justice, and the common folk of his realm already speak of the “Good King Agsile,” his vassals tend to find him awkward and standoffish. While his eagerness to be a good king for everyone is evident to them, many of them whisper that he doesn’t have the spine to be a strong king. Many, instead, look to the king’s nephew, an ambitious and charismatic young man. Will his nephew succeed in ousting the good king, or will Agsile manage to hold on to the throne?"
 
#  bookmark_nots_iqaluit:0 "High Chieftain Jaasin"
#  bookmark_nots_iqaluit_desc:0 "A dashing adventurer in his youth, Jaasin underwent a journey that clasped at the boundaries of the known world and brought him fortune, glory, and a beautiful wife. He sailed into the Chukchi Sea and across the Bering Strait, meeting peoples few other even believe to be real. \n Now as he reaches middle age, Jaasin feels a deep hole in his spirit. His relationship with his foreign wife Maria has become strained and in his sleep, Jaasin dreams of distant shores and unknown lands. Will Jaasin embrace his wanderlust, or will he accept that his most treasured memories are forever behind him?"
 
#  bookmark_nots_avalon:0 "Morgan 'la Fay'"
#  bookmark_nots_avalon_desc:0 "Morgan was an entirely unremarkable child, the youngest of Gorlois Power’s seven children. Her fate, as much as can be described, was to be married off for alliance and prestige to one of the other Newfie lords, or to one of her father’s knights as a reward. That fate was upended entirely when, at age 12, she was struck down by a sickness that left her comatose for a week while her siblings were claimed one by one. When she awoke, finding her family gone and herself Queen of Avalon, Morgan spoke of having visited the realms of the fae, dancing with antlered courtiers, and been promised a great kingdom by a heather-crowned king enthroned in a mushroom-hall. Will the drive and ambition of this young woman bind together the tribes and petty kings of Newfoundland, or have the fae conspired to lead another mortal astray?"
 
#  bookmark_nots_gwichin:0 "High Chieftain Paul"
#  bookmark_nots_gwichin_desc:0 "Duke Paul is the most recent member of the ancient and prestigious house Charlie to unite the Gwich'in peoples, done by way of his unrivaled martial talents. \n Powerful enough to fend off his more threatening neighbors, like the heretical Inupiat on the coast, Paul's attentions are now drawn to several distinct possibilities of expansion: he could move into the Mackenzie and work to bind together the disunited peoples of Denendeh, proceed downriver to become protector of the peoples of the lower Yukon, or, at the urging of the faithful, he could stamp out the northern outposts of pagan idolatry in Dawson and Fairbanks, at last opening up the south to God and the Gwich'in. Where does his next conquest lie?"
 
#  bookmark_nots_alaska:0 "Duke Nikolas"
#  bookmark_nots_alaska_desc:0 "Nikolas Valdeez is a learned man of law and order, and he knows much about the place of Alaska as the final frontier of Old America. He maintains a realm with greater technology and awareness of the past than any of its neighbours, and feels quite content to maintain what he has. Beyond the rich fishing waters of Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound, and the farmlands of the Mat-Su valley, there is little of immediate value to be taken: rustic tribes of trailwalkers further inland, Aleutian fishermen down the coast, and the stubbornly hostile Tlingit of the panhandle. However, his two sons Joseph and Gregory recognize that their realm is in a prime position to reunite the ancient 49th state, should it be inherited by a man of ambition. The frontier, they dream, may yet return home."
 
#  bookmark_nots_qaqortoq:0 "Chieftain Nanoq"
#  bookmark_nots_qaqortoq_desc:0 "Upon his birth, the white-haired son of Chief Eerik of Qaqortok was given the name Nanoq, meaning "polar bear" in Kalaallisut, following a traditional belief that by giving a child the name of an animal, they took on some of the characteristics of that animal. Be it divine interaction or coincidence, Nanoq indeed grew up strong and brave, but also calm and honest, feared and respected for his martial skills, raw power, and snow-white hair. His skills, bravery, and fame will help him achieve many feats, maybe even fulfilling his birthright by blood - claiming the throne of Greenland."
