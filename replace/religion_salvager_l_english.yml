 EVTDESC_salvage_machinery:0 "Amongst a wreck of disintegrated iron you find a fabulously preserved piece of Old World machinery. Though stained with rust the beautiful object itself does not seem to have rusted. It is about three feet across irregularly shaped with a half-dozen holes perfectly cut partway through it.

 EVTDESC_salvage_shades:0 "You have found a long-abandoned pair of old-world glasses. Although they at first appear to be coated in dust further inspection reveals that the glasses are tinted.

The paintings depict a family of people in the Old World.

 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_musicbox:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of small ornate boxes about the size of your palm. Each box contains a cylinder with patterns of tiny protrusions adjacent to an array of metal tines of various lengths. You twist the small crank on the side of a box, and it begins to plink out an Old World melody that probably hasn't been heard for centuries.\n\nThis will be a hit among my courtiers... a song for the ages!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_machinery:0 "Machinery!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_electric:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a complicated piece of Old World technology, the purpose of which is a mystery to you. The artifact features several prominent finely blown glass bubbles, mechanical innards, and thin flexible metal strands that shed greenish-black powder when disturbed.\n\nYou are unable to get the artifact to do anything. There seems to be something missing that you don't understand."
 EVTNAME_salvage_safe_firearm:0 "Firepower!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_firearm:0 "The safe door finally opens and you can see the contents: a long metal tube with various bits of metal and brittle wood attached to it. You've heard stories that Old World knights used such devices to produce fire from nothing, but it's hard to believe you're seeing one for yourself.\n\nThough the safe has preserved it well, you will have to handle it gently and be unable to fix it if it breaks."
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_typewriter:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Underwood" written on it in gleaming gold-leaf letters. Rows of thumbnail-sized metal disks are attached to the complicated mechanical innards of the machine, each labeled with a unique rune.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of recovered tech, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it..."
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_calculator:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Arithmometer" engraved in the metal in a flowing script. The machine is dominated by a heavy horizontal metal cylinder with numerals visible through gaps in the metal shell, and a hefty metal hand-crank on the side.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of tech art, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it..."
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_watch:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a golden palm-sized clamshell disk attached to an intricate chain of gold. When you open the clamshell you see that one side is labelled with the numerals I through XII and you realize that the artifact is an Old World timekeeping device.\n\nIt would be a stylish accessory for any lord but it would be even more useful if you could understand its workings and restore its function."
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_optics:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a segmented set of brass tubes with several curved internal mirrors and smoothly bulging disks of polished glass. The tools and knowledge to craft such a device have been lost but you recognize it as an Old World version of today's spyglass.\n\nYou will be able to see things from a great distance."
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_textbooks:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several stacks of thick books. They have been sealed away from the ravages of the weather but the centuries have still taken their toll on their brittle brown pages.\n\nWith luck, a scholar fluent in Old World languages will be able to extract useful information from the books before they crumble into dust."
 EVTDESC_salvage_safe_compass:0 "The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a small metal disc with a string attached to it. As you hold the item, you notice that there is a free-floating needle inside. You realize that the artifact is a hand-held Old World navigational device.\n\nOnce you learn how to properly calibrate and use it it is unlikely that you will ever lose your way again."
 EVTNAME_salvage_result:0 "Salvage Expedition ends"
 EVTDESC_salvage_result_poor:0 "Not all Salvage Expeditions end in success. Sometimes the recovered artifacts are badly damaged. Sometimes they are worthless. Sometimes there isn't anything to salvage because the area has been picked clean. And sometimes dangerous circumstances interrupt the expedition.\n\nThis is one of those times."

It remains to be seen whether you can return the artifact to a functional state.\n\nThis will surely bring you fame power and understanding of the old world."
 EVTOPT_salvage_result_study:0 "I must study and repair my prize."
 EVTNAME_salvage_repair_prize:0 "The Past Restored"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_firearm:0 "After weeks of study your armorers have finally restored your Old World firearm to working condition! Much of the wood body had to be replaced but the metal parts were functional. The charges required to operate the weapon are in extremely short supply, as many of those found alongside the weapon were dangerously unstable and your armorers do not yet know how to construct additional charges.\n\nYou will be a fearsome and inspiring figure on the battlefield!"
 EVTOPT_salvage_study_firearm:0 "This is my boomstick!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_calculator:0 "After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your numeric calculating machine to working condition! You are still learning how to operate it: you enter numerals by sliding the levers into the correct positions then turn the heavy crank and the machine produces the result of addition in mere seconds.\n\nThis will make it much easier to keep track of the rents and taxes that are owed to you!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_watch:0 "After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your gilded timekeeping device to working condition! Once the device is activated by inserting a key and twisting it it begins to emit a soft ticking sound, and the slender arms move smoothly across its face. You must handle the artifact carefully because many of its small parts are irreplaceable.\n\nYou will be aided in any tasks that require precise measurement of time!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_typewriter:0 "After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your lettering machine to working condition! Their fingertips are black from handling powdered charcoal and other attempts at creating a useful ink. Study of the device has revealed much about the prowess of Old World smiths.\n\nYou are now able to issue decrees in the neat authoritative letters of Underwood himself!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_optics:0 "After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your brass spyglass to working condition! Polishing with a soft cloth has brought the shine back to the metal, while the glass optics have retained their nearly perfect transparency. When you look through the eyepiece you are able to see things at a distance others could only dream about, even gazing at the Moon and stars as the people of the Old World must have.\n\nThe potential military advantages are enormous!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_textbooks:0 "After weeks of study, your scholars have learned many things about your collection of pre-calamity books. Several of the books have fallen to pieces during transport or study but those that survived are providing valuable insight into medicine engineering and other topics.\n\nMore study will reveal additional secrets of the old world!"
 EVTDESC_salvage_study_compass:0 "After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your compass to working condition! The needle inside the compass has been recalibrated and the quicksilver inside has been refillled. You are still figuring out exactly how to orient yourself with it but you feel as if you're getting better at it over time.\n\nThis will make it nearly impossible for you to get lost on long journeys."
