The Ursulines uphold the position that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession, making them invalid.

Celestes worship many messianic figures, including José Maria, Teodora and Maria Rosa. They believe that these figures were blessed with divine visions, and were thus chosen by divine providence to lead their followers in so-called “celestial communities”. Celestes often take inspiration from Old World traditions such as chivalry and chastity, shunning earthly pleasures and inflicting heavy punishment on deviants and enemies of the faith. Nevertheless, they often mix esoteric and mystic elements into their Christian doctrine, and Celestes have great respect for healers and miracle workers."

They are distinguished from other Catholic faiths by their special focus on Our Lady of Guadalupe, Empress of the Americas and mother of Christ the King. In addition, the Cristeros believe that the best method of protecting the faith is to preserve the houses of God throughout the continent, as their importance to the history and practice of the religion is unrivaled. To accomplish the task, men of the cloth are expected to go to battle to defend the faith, and all Holy and Lay Orders are placed under the command of the Archbishop Primate who, due to the continued absence of the Bishop of Rome, only answers to Cristo Rey himself."

While these rituals were once performed only on Easter, Penitents believe that, since the Deluge, every week has become worthy of special gratitude. These acts of penitence can be as small as praying with their faces to the floor and as large as serving as pallbearers to enormous images depicting the passion of Christ. These rituals are often organized by brotherly associations called Moradas, which also serve as sanctuaries and stops along the weekly procession."

Particularly, the deer and matachin dances are major events in the faith’s community, and the schedule of the celebrations are followed rigorously. Outsiders are met with scorn and resistance, as the Cahita refuse to ever subjugate or surrender themselves to any enemy."

In closed-off communities, unmarried men, referred to as "fathers" by their flock, secretly perform sacraments while outwardly participating in the rites of their Satanic overlords. The faithful hold mass clandestinely where they clutch disguised rosaries made from conchs and carved wood, praying quietly for Jesus to deliver them from the demons which surround them. The most valuable possessions of these communities are the remnants of church relics and icons that have managed to survive the pagan onslaught, physical evidence of a past where Rome, lost across the ocean, reigned supreme."

Openly embracing the syncretic traditions of popular Catholicism and the Afro-Brazilian faiths, the liturgy of the Santeiros often evolve into colorful public processions, incorporating drumming and songs in the sacred Portuguese and Yoruba languages. Believers also put great importance on the worship of the Christian saints, who are often conflated with the orixás of Candomblé, allowing for many rites and sacraments to be shared by both faiths. The main ceremonies of the Santeiros are the yearly festivals in praise of the Virgin Mary, also honored as the orixá Iemanjá, a series of celebrations led by the Patriarch of Salvador himself."

The Giles have prayed to Gauchito Gil for many generations, beseeching their flawed yet honest hero to guide them through life's hardships. Despite his imperfections, Antonio Gil found God in his final moments, where he was given the power to do good, and in a selfless act proving his redemption, he healed the child of his executioner. The movement is mainly comprised of hardened rural gauchos and farmers, who understand that as long as they pray and pay homage to Antonio Gil through his many shrines, they will be granted the same mercy he received, and will reach heaven."

Laypeople are supposed to have a more active role in the church, along with maintaining and nurturing a 'personal relationship with Jesus'. While existing at the margins of Catholicism in the Americas today, the Church's faithful continue to practice their unusual approach to Catholicism in many areas."

Named after their method for treating and cleansing the souls of the suffering with prayer and local herbs called "traitement", traiteurs and traiteuses fulfill the spiritual needs of their community. These skilled healers administer the seven sacraments and absolve the sins of the sick through traitement so that they may go directly to Heaven.

 compadecidos_desc:0 "Like many other communities around the New World, the Marian Brotherhood of Compassion - Compadecidos - believe that the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] was indeed the second coming of Christ. However, He has not returned to save our souls, but to judge us, condemning all mankind - sinners and faithful alike - to spend eternity on this cursed Earth. Nevertheless, the human race may still be saved through their good deeds, if they follow the lead of the wise men God-Almighty periodically sends to dwell in our world, such as Antônio Conselheiro, Padre Cícero, Frei Damião and the Prophet Gentileza. Through their prayers, these preachers can reach to a pantheon of hundreds of saints and, most importantly, to the Mother of Christ, the Virgin Mary herself, who may intercede on humanity's favor, convincing Jesus Christ that mankind is still worth saving."

In the absence of contact with Rome, the movement still perseveres as a decentralized network of lay-identifying Catholic believers promoting nonviolent direct action against the unjust systems of poverty they see around them. Theologically, despite their differences in social outlook, the Catholic Workers remain staunch in traditional doctrine, though they remain aloof from the St. Louis Papacy and other successor churches in general. Their practice of support for the impoverished makes them a common sight tending to the poorest in North American towns."

Regardless of its specific origin point, the Synodalists of today stand resolute in professing a universal and open creed in stark contrast to most more conservative Catholic successor organizations of the post-Event Americas. With influences from liberal theology and a broad range of predecessor movements, the Synodalists have embraced democratic church governance and harmonized it with Catholic structure, resulting in a truly universal and socially conscious Church that ‘walks together with all of its flock’ as they put it."

As a result of this crisis, exorcism is no longer a ritual confined to the clergy, but rather something that all lay believers can and should perform. As consequence, any organization or group that continues to deny this reality is clearly collaborating with demonic forces, the same that brought forth the Deluge. Today, the group is marginalized, forced into the shadows of larger Catholic bodies, where it lurks, preparing for its eventual triumphant emergence."

Under this, in exchange for abandoning the most extreme and reactionary positions of the church, its status will be protected and upheld by the authority of Mexico’s leadership. The chosen patron for these Catomexas is the Secretario General of the Alineadorato, who the faithful believe is the strongest force standing against the chaotic work of Satan and demonic influence, which their patron calls “Cosmos”. While widely disliked by most other faiths for their hardline opposition to heresy and sole focus on Mexico, the Catomexa Apostolic Church has maintained solid relations with their benefactor over the course of their crusade for Order and Progress."

Though solutions to the problem of succession, such as the St. Louis Papacy or Ursuline position, were eventually formulated, many bishops were excluded from the coalescing churches for their refusal to comply with perceived innovations in doctrine or organization of the one undivided church. These 'episcopi vagantes', or stray bishops, found the solution to their apostolic problems in the doctrine of Old Catholicism - a theological position which held the Catholic Church had strayed long before the Event and that their small communities had maintained the true faith all this time. This claim of legitimacy appealed to these stray bishops, causing Old Catholicism to surge from small insular communities to a sizeable minority position in North America. Where the other Catholics squabble over the lineage of Rome, the Old Catholics remain independent and unperturbed."
