 guruist_religion_desc:0 "Created by the first post-Event Emperor of California, Elton the Lawgiver, Guruism unifies the diverse expressions of spirituality, philosophy, and religion of the earth by revealing their underlying oneness and Californian character. Officially, the movement is stewarded only by the office of the Eternal Living Guru, a position deeply intertwined with Imperial governance and the office of the Golden Emperor itself, with all spiritual and temporal concerns of California existing in absolute harmony beneath its majesty. In reality, there are many dissenting sects opposed to the Imperial mainstream who assert their own interpretations of the Lawgiver's message, often through violent means."

 anahata_desc:0 "Rejecting constrictive power structures built around corruptions of the Eternal Living Vanguard’s revolutionary teachings, students of the Praxis Way seek to reach [eureka|E] via direct action. Followers base their beliefs on the assumption that spiritual enlightenment first comes from individual emanations of the larger collective consciousness, given straight to the people, rather than via the doctrines of any earthly power. Therefore, to provide the freedom from subversive thought necessary for a person to advance their spirituality and thereby escape from the mechanisms of mortal oppression known as [Concept('the_machine','the Machine')|E], communities must be reorganized based upon principles of communal living. In addition to their political aims, the Praxis Way incorporates numerous ‘Sages’, which are often ignored or denounced by other sects."

This is done by utilizing the wisdom of warriors who came before, those who found [eureka|E] through their self-discipline and prowess in martial arts. Zealous adherents often take on a wandering ascetic lifestyle, while most instead focus on honing a single skill, demonstrating their own focus and commitment. As they believe that the teachings of the Eternal Living Guru are already complete and flawless, the faith organizes itself in militant bands, devoted to defending the weak and innocent with their spiritual and physical strength."

While the Lawgiver’s project was corrupted by vestigial remains of pre-Aquarian energies, another coming form of the World Teacher is soon to rise up and finalize a new civilization for this psychically strong age. Therefore followers of the Aquarian Way are ready to take any action necessary in order to complete the World Teacher’s mission of bringing humanity into karmic ascendance."
