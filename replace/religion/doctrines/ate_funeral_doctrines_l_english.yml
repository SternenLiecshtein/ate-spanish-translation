 doctrine_funeral_consecrative_name:0 "Consecrative"
 doctrine_funeral_consecrative_desc:0 "The honored dead deserved to be remembered for their deeds in the name of [ROOT.Faith.PantheonTerm] and sacrifices for us all.

Plants may be seeded above the location, so life can spring from death."

 doctrine_funeral_taboo_name:0 "Taboo"

 doctrine_parameter_cannot_do_funeral_activity:0 "Cannot conduct nor attend [funeral|E] [activities|E]"
