 buddhism_religion_desc:0 "Buddhism originated three thousand years ago in the far off land of India, where it was taught by a sage known as Siddhartha Gautama of the Shakya clan. Upon attaining enlightenment, he took the title of "the Buddha", the enlightened one, and began to spread his message. The core teachings of Buddhism revolve around the four noble truths -that birth, life, and death lead to suffering; that the origin of this is craving; that by giving up craving one is released from suffering and rebirth; and that the means of attaining this is the noble eightfold path, a set of ethical and moral tenets."

Members of the sect await the imminent return of the Maitreya from Shambhala, who will triumph over the Asuras to usher in a new age of peace. The most important preparation is of the soul, primarily done through mediations which affirm the innate goodness of all human beings. In addition, the faithful attempt to create an enlightened and powerful society, one composed entirely of "spirit-warriors". Until the coming of the Maitreya, humans will be unable to reach their ultimate form as [dharmapalas|E], though those that are strong enough will ascend to Shambhala in order to join the armies of the Maitreya instead of reincarnating. However, while on Earth, followers are encouraged to not pursue violence, rather be ready to stand strong against it in whatever form it may take."

These efforts are believed to contribute to the collective enlightenment of humanity. While monks focus principally on spiritual development through mindfulness, they also cultivate compassion through conversations with lay people and assistance to those in need. Lay members themselves cultivate spiritual merit through volunteer work, donations, and personal kindness."

Additionally, the details of the precepts which a member of the sect is expected to follow tend to vary, and there is little shame among members in admitting that finding Enlightenment is a journey unique to each individual."

This includes the Buddha, who is viewed as being a wise elder worthy of the same respect as a grandparent, but also extends to the land itself. The faith itself is organized via lodges, which generally act autonomously, but tend to share very similar beliefs and practices. Often a minority, the Great Spirit Path nonetheless has found a place for itself in the diverse landscape of the post-Event West."

The faithful must break both the cycle of rebirth known as Samsara, as well as the earthly structures of oppression known as the Combine. To do this, adherents engage in ritualized usage of psychedelics and marijuana in order to cultivate their senses, so that they may expand their consciousness beyond the limits imposed by Suffering. Additionally, the faith spreads the enlightenment of the Buddha using songs, hymns, and chants, and often incorporates these into meditation. Eschewing monasticism, Beatzen emphasizes the lessons which any person can learn, regardless of their lifestyle, from the Buddha or his various bodhisattvas. Instead, the faithful focus on the experiences of the laypeople, embracing the need to open your home and heart to strangers of all kinds."
