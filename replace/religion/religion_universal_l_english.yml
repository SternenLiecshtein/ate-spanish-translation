 universal_religion_desc:1 "Universal religions believe in the inherent equality and truth in all religions, and that every creed gets a least a little part correct. Many believe that God or the gods revealed their Truth bit by bit, each part becoming a separate religion and that combining them is the best interpretation that can be found. Universalists usually have a tolerant view of the world, and hold pluralistic beliefs concerning the well-being of humanity around the globe, regardless of faith. While many still hold on to traditional structures and societal conventions of religion, other faiths preach complete freedom in finding the truth of the world, whatever that truth might be."

Despite this, there has been very little deviation from the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, which preach for a world united in peace and justice. The Baha’i believe that this unity has been dealt out piecemeal by God, who revealed it to various prophets and divine teachers over the centuries. As a result, the Baha’i abhor religious violence and promote a tolerant, pacifistic lifestyle that continues to persist into the 27th century."

These various traditions give way to inspiration and insight taken from all religions, although special regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love above other elements of theology."

 scottish_rite_adherent_plural:0 "Scottish Rite Masons"
 scottish_rite_desc:0 "As their full name would suggest, the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is one of the oldest rites of Freemasonry present in the Americas. Consisting of 33 degrees, or ranks, the Scottish Rite has preserved many of the customs and rituals that other Masonic organizations across the continents have adapted with the progression of time, such as the requirement to profess belief in a Supreme Being, the presence of scripture of some kind at meetings, and a total ban on discussion of politics within the walls of their lodges. Each of the degrees embodies a teaching within the broader philosophy of the Masonic Lodge, weaving together into a dramatic retelling of the story of King Solomon’s Temple. As Masonic ritual contains the physical processes of building the temple, the degrees contain the spiritual processes of self-improvement, building the person."
