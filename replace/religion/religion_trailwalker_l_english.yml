However, El Centauro is not yet gone, as a tiny cactus managed to save one droplet of his blood and, forever imbued with the divine’s blood, managed to grow strong as a rock, tall as a mountain, and spread all across the land. And so El Mero Mero and La Adelita sang a song of legend, claiming that El Centauro may once again return after enough Saguaros grow tall and strong across the land. Anyone who listened to the song and took it into their heart became a protector of the Saguaro, a Saguarorrinche, tasked with protecting the Camposantos from those that defile them by creating trails to El Otro Lado while under the spell of the seducer, La Bestia, and her mistress, La Migra."
