 americanist_religion_adherent_plural:1 "Americanists"
 americanist_religion_desc:1 "Americanists believe that the ancient United States was a land uniquely blessed by Providence, a country where every man was free from want, fear and all treachery or tyranny. This prosperity stemmed from the people's belief in the American Dream, which ensured that America stayed on the path of prosperity and liberty. However, that Dream was forsaken by the people of the past, for the America of today is a shadow of its former self; a mere memory of a memory. Yet America can never truly die, and those who still believe in the Dream diligently work towards the day when Providence will once again grant America life, liberty and happiness."

 constitutionalist_adj: "Constitutional"

 constitutionalist_adherent_plural: "Constitutionals"
 constitutionalist_desc: "A key element of Americanism is its emphasis on jurisprudence, with followers and judges constantly striving to uphold what they consider to be the law of the land. The Constitutionals, however, reject much of mainstream Americanism’s legal rulings as deviation from the Founders’ vision. The original meaning of the Constitution, the divine law of mankind, can only be understood by the gods - mortal men cannot improve upon perfection. The mortal men that succeeded the divine Founders were quick to misinterpret the Constitution and corrupt the laws of the land. With the door to apotheosis closed long before the Event, judges must rigorously study under the Founders to gain insight into the divine intent of the law. Constitutionals decry the overwhelming majority of rulings by mainstream Americanists as ‘innovations’, instead relying upon their own corpus built upon the Founders' unsullied words."

 principlist_adj: "Principlist"

 principlist_adherent_plural: "Principlists"
 principlist_desc: "Principlists regard the Constitution, the sacred document given down by the divine Founders, not as a static corpus of written law but a living symbol of America, the binding together of many into one Union. As the needs of America and her countrymen change, so too does the Constitution, all centered on the core values of the American Dream - life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is the duty of all citizens, from the lowliest farmer to the President themself, to pursue this dream and protect it so others have the opportunity to pursue it also. Principlists are not afraid to break from precedent should they believe the Dream to be compromised, aiming to uphold and defend the just society the Founders started."

 libertarian_desc: "The Children of Liberty break from mainstream Americanist thought by proclaiming Lady Liberty as the sole righteous divinity, with the Founders as prophets of her message. Monolatrists, Libertarians expound that Liberty and all her aspects reign above all others as the highest law in the land. Lady Liberty is the Torch-bearer whose shining light enables anyone to prosper in the land of opportunity, to break one’s chains and achieve one’s desires with equal opportunity. Long welcoming the downtrodden with her open arms, Libertarians emphasize that only through providential Liberty does the American Dream become within reach. Due to their denial of the Founders’ full divinity, Libertarians occupy the fringes of what most Americanists would consider their religious brethren."

True Americans must therefore strive to achieve their own dreams and maintain an attitude of confidence, creativity and optimism. The Founders, Providence and the abstract "Spirit of America" fill their followers with great determination and can bring them equally great success no matter the odds. However, the confidence of Imaginerians must not be mistaken for foolishness – they are perfectly aware that not every venture can end in material success. However, the truly devoted will find unexpected rewards in everything they do; Providence never leaves a dreamer unrewarded."

 yeomanist_desc: "The followers of the Yeoman’s Creed believe that Jefferson was the greatest of the Founders and that his vision of America was not a single monolithic empire stretching from sea to sea, but a confederation of independent realms on the land to be peopled and governed by the “yeoman farmer”, who he saw as the ideal human. Yeomen believe that every American has sovereign rights and privileges under the Common Law and that the President’s claimed spiritual authority is a sham designed to subjugate the strength of the People to the whims of a single man; as a result, Yeomen do not possess any kind of central religious structure and detest those who attempt to impose one on them."

 mayflower_adherent_plural: "Continentals"
 mayflower_desc: "Unlike most Americanists, the Continental Society believes in a dualist cosmology - Providence, embodied in the Spirit of 76, represents all that is good, while Tyranny’s evil is equal in measure. With the courageous leadership of the Founders, America was born as a land of pure freedom, but over time Tyranny grew within the nation like a cancerous wound. Eventually, Tyranny overthrew Old America in the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], permanently mixing its evil into the land. Continentals reject the modern institutions and trappings of mainstream Americanism, given that positions like the Presidency cannot exist in a reality tainted by Tyranny, and instead assert those institutions will be restored when Tyranny is finally defeated and the universe is purified. To accomplish this goal, the Continentals emulate their Patriot ancestors and their freedom-loving ways, inviting the Spirit of 76 to fortify their souls against tyrannical corruption."

These offspring, the Founders, were partly man, partly divine, who became great heroes to set an example for other mortals. They made war only when necessary, and taught of the Heart and Soul of America. The Heart is the land itself, while the Soul are the people of America, both of which must be treated with decency and respect. After the Founders had built America, they sacrificed themselves for their country, guaranteeing all who they left behind the opportunity to enjoy the bountiful harvest that they had sown. Now that America lies in ruins, it is more important than ever before that the faithful cultivate the same steadfast values that built this country long ago."
