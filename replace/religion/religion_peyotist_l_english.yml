 half_moon_desc:0 "The followers of the Half Moon Hearth, so named for the setup of the central altar, consider themselves the first expression of Peyotism and reject many overtly Christian doctrines and texts. While followers may still identify with certain Christian beliefs, and certainly treat Jesus with a great deal of respect, they prefer to emphasize traditional spirits and practices alongside the peyote ceremony, focusing their prayers on ancestor spirits and other gods venerated by the tribe. As such, Half Moon practice tends to be diverse and personalized, while also unifying in its strong reverence for the ceremony."

With its greater structure, they have established ordination and hierarchy as well as a more systematized ritual. Their more elaborate and energized ritual services use the Bible explicitly as well as centrally, and they pray to Jesus during the peyote ceremony. Many consider themselves Christians as well as Peyotists and take a multifaceted approach to religious practice."

 big_moon_desc:0 "The Big Moon Hearth was the original source of Christian influence in Peyotist religious practice; however, unlike their Cross Fire cousins, they place more emphasis on personal revelation and prophecy, in addition to some minor differences in the style of rites and ceremonies. While some would say they tread a middle road between overt Christianity and more indigenous religion, the Big Moon ceremony still falls closer to the former in most eyes. This emphasis on the personal over the communal has led to it being somewhat less open and, consequently, smaller throughout the centuries."
