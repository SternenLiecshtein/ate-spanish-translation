 seaspray_religion_adj:1 "Seasprayer"
 seaspray_religion_adherent:1 "Seasprayer"
 seaspray_religion_adherent_plural:1 "Seasprayers"
 seaspray_religion_desc:1 "Grown from the roots of the Christian practices that their Canadian ancestors left behind, the Seasprayer religions have incorporated an eclectic myriad of oral tales and legends from the misty rocks and forests of the North Atlantic, though the tales might vary from village to village, all followers of a Seasprayer faith recognize the tremendous power of their waters and the bounties it can bring. Though only distantly related due to the march of time, many aspects of the Seasprayer faiths can trace their origin to Christianity, with other influences coming in the form of originally Indigenous legends, and topped off by the tales that have been told on these cold shores longer than anyone can recall."

 pelagic_adherent_plural:0 "Fogsinger"
 pelagic_desc:0 "The Fogsongs tell of Brother Jack, the defender of humanity and his sacrifice long ago. During the Moratorium; when the seas were empty and the fishermen starved, Jack sought a resolution. He was told by Father Patrick what he must do, and jumped into the ocean. There he transformed into a great whale, and from his maw flowed all the life of the seas. The seas were rejuvenated - but humanity, no longer under the protection of Brother Jack, fell into chaos. The Fairies and Spirits returned to the lands of man, wreaking magical havoc and trickery upon them. The Fogsingers still remember the sacrifice of Jack to sustain them, but now they must contend against those from the Otherworld."

 mervivant_desc:0 "Shaped by the chilly winds that carry along the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Cycle of Merivivant worships the life given to them by all-supreme God, the Living Water, who brings life to His children with assistance from the shining light of le Radieux Beasoleil. Possessing a communal memory of their legendary expulsion from Acadia, le Grand Derangement, the faithful were kept alive by the Living Water. During the forty years of this forced Exodus, they were guided to their current home by the loving light of le Radieux Beasoleil while they floated adrift at sea. Even after surviving the expulsion, the harsh winters and scarcity of the post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E] world has only reinforced the connection that the Merivivant have to their beliefs, making their shared struggles the core of the faith's identity. Central to the group's understanding of their community since the expulsion are traditions of celebrations and songs, in which they honor and celebrate the accomplishments of holy figures, including saints, legendary heroes, angels, and above all the triune Living Water."
