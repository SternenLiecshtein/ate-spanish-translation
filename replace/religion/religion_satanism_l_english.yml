 satanism_religion_adherent:1 "Satanist"
 satanism_religion_adherent_plural:1 "Satanists"
 satanism_religion_desc:1 "Often misunderstood as a simple inversion of Christianity, Satanism instead rejects the trappings of the church it decries as having a stranglehold on morality and society. In its place, Satanists elevate the individual, viewing the pursuit of one's self-interest as the most important aspect of life. Inherently anti-mainstream, Satanist belief can range wildly from denomination to denomination or even person to person, with even their central figure being viewed alternatively as a divine figure or metaphorical representation of the human condition."

 church_of_satan_desc:0 "Claiming to be the first openly Satanist denomination, the Church of Satan, having been founded in antediluvian times by the High Priest LaVey, discards the dogma of Christianity and centers itself around the individual and their ego. LaVeyan Satanism rejects any external master over man, instead encouraging practitioners to pursue their own desires as masters of themselves, not servants of external authority. Though they deny the existence of gods, the Church of Satan openly encourages the practice of magic, seeing it as a tool by which the powerful may make their will manifest in reality."

 activist_satanism_desc:0 "Despite its relatively small size, the Temple of Advocation wields outsize influence in interfaith debates in the Americanist sphere. Like other doctrinaire Satanists, the Temple rejects the notion of external gods and views Satan as a liberating metaphor instead of a literal figure, but expands their definition of liberation and freedom beyond the scope of the individual. It is the role of institutions to protect the personal liberty of the people, and the greatest of these institutions is the government set out by the Constitution of the United States of America. Seeing the founders as analogues to Satan and his struggle for liberty against tyranny, Advocationists seek to uphold the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, especially if those rights are threatened by the selfish."

This was a violation of the sacred Noahide Covenant, which finally forced Jesus revolt with his fallen brother, Lucifer, and protect mankind from the hatred of their grim creator. The two now lead humankind together in righteous rebellion against their father, bringing Light to the world by ending the dim tyranny of Jehovah. Lucifer illuminated Adam and Eve with divine knowledge and Jesus brought radiant compassion to mankind, but both efforts were hampered by the gloomy Jehovah’s wrath. However, once the followers of the false deity are defeated, then an age of justice will shine bright across the earth, creating a world where all people can live together peacefully in freedom and brotherhood."

 delver: "Dungeon Delvers"
 delver_adj: "Delver"
 delver_adherent: "Delver"
 delver_adherent_plural: "Delvers"
 delver_desc: "The superstitions of the old Abrahamic traditions are vast, containing a panoply of powerful demons, secret rites, and deadly rituals, which the insane, powerhungry, or deluded perform as part of their own twisted agenda to undermine good Christian society. However, once in a blue moon, an individual or small party, seduced by the very tales meant to warn them, undertake the path to glory and dark power. These ambitious few encounter a staggeringly vast and diverse collection of esoterica which span the centuries both before and after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E]. Thankfully, the unifying principle which underlies all of its complexities is straightforward: to receive something, one must make an equivalent exchange, and the more coveted the tribute, the greater the reward. Therefore, to maximize their own benefit and because the lesser rituals often automatically mark practitioners for death in the eyes of the mainstream anyway, human sacrifice tends to become the favored method of pleasing the ultimate [dungeon_master|E]: Satan himself."
