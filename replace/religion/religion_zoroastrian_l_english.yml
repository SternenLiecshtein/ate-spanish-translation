While only a pale reflection of its former relevance, Zoroastrianism has survived the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] relatively intact, with the devout continuing to seek the path of Truth through Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds."

 ashavanite_desc:0 "Claiming to be the eldest of all codified faiths, Ashavanites proclaim the totally righteous teachings of the ancient prophet Zarathustra and the single divinity, Ahura Mazda, from whom all else springs. The purpose of life is the arduous purification of one's druj-tainted existence until they embody the Truth completely. Though it is one's spirit which becomes pure, the medium in which it is perfected is the material existence of the body, which experiences the effects of the process. This spiritual evolution occurs on both an individual and collective level, stretching out from the person to encompass existence as a whole, a concept known as Frashokereti."

 mazdayasna_new_desc:0 "Before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], New York served as one of the havens for the Zoroastrian community fleeing persecution in their ancient homeland. After the Event, however, those in the region were cut off from their far-flung brethren across Old America, more isolated than ever before. In response, the mobeds held tight to their fire temples and the communities which surrounded them, enduring the tumult that ushered the city into the new post-Event world. Mazdayans believe that the world is divided between two polar opposites - Ahura Mazda, the ultimate good, and Ahriman, the ultimate evil. Though the two forces battle now, Ahura Mazda will inevitably prevail, assisted by those people who choose to follow the teachings of the prophet Zarathrustra and the path of Asha."
