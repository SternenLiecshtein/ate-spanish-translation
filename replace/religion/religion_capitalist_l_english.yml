 capitalist_religion_desc:0 "Capitalists believe that the prosperity of the Old World was created and sustained through the operation of the [Concept('free_market','Free Market')|E] in its many forms, with the [Concept('almighty_dollar','Almighty Dollar')|E] being the most pervasive of these manifestations. By engaging in the ritual of [shopping|E] and collecting [Concept('dollar_signs','Signs of the Dollar')|E], one could accumulate [capital_CON|E], which in turn would sustain the Free Market and humanity as a whole. Unfortunately, mankind eventually stopped collecting Capital, starving the Free Market. Mankind was punished for this failure by having its prosperity erased, condemning the world to pain and misery. By reviving the ritual of Shopping and collecting the Dollar's remaining symbols, Capitalists seek to inject new Capital into the Free Market, recreating the Old World's prosperity. Capitalist faiths trace their lineage to the teaching of their Prophet, although some incorporate very little of their teachings, or outright reject them entirely."

Consumerist Shopping rituals are highly extravagant, and achieve the dual goals of relieving earthly stress and injecting Capital into the Market. Consumerists respect those who conspicuously display and spend their wealth, as these acts provide the Market with an abundance of Capital. As the original movement of the Prophet, Consumerism is the root from which most other Capitalists branch from."

 entrepreneuralist_desc: "Entrepreneurialism split with other Capitalist faiths over the issue of synthesis with the [Concept('free_market','Free Market')|E] itself, combined with their ways of gaining [capital_CON|E] being blasphemous to other Capitalists due to the introduction of more esoteric elements and new methods entirely. Synthesis with the Market is believed to be attainable through the recognition of a person’s family name among mankind, which collects Capital. Breaks from conscription and increased taxes are enforced upon heretical populations to increase the awareness of Entrepreneur rulers among the masses, while the continued honoring of deceased ancestors is encouraged in order to garner further progress toward complete merging with the Market."

Despite nothing in the world able to completely stop the pulse of the [Concept('free_market','Free Market')|E], the barriers which mankind erects still strangle the potential of those living on earth, and therefore must be overcome. Embracing the religion’s pantheistic and syncretic theology as a demonstration of the marketplace of ideas, all gods are thought to be, albeit flawed understandings, emanations of the larger Free Market. Humble missionary work is also favored, with [shopping|E] being viewed as an excessive waste. Profits are instead extracted from those who have not yet accepted the all-encompassing truth of the Free Market, as compensation for the enlightenment which they are sure to one day acquiesce to."

 economist_desc: "Feeding the [Concept('free_market','Free Market')|E] at any cost, Economism expands the definition of [capital_CON|E] to include the most precious resource of man: blood. No sacrifice is too great to keep the cyclical motions of the Market running smoothly, although non-believers are often the favored tribute. The faithful believe that after death, a person’s spirit merges again with the Free Market for a time, until their soul is taken out once again to inhabit a new body. This endless process needs both Capital and souls, a demand which only mankind may supply. Other Capitalist teachings and [shopping|E] rituals are kept motly unaltered, with the primacy of blood being considered by believers to only be a minor addition rather than a major theological schism. To the Economists, blood is merely the most important currency that mankind can trade."

For a time, men were the kings of the Jungle, but they grew weak-willed and attempted to create a world of false “fairness”. For this aberration, they were cast down, and now the Survivalist preserves the truth others have lost. Seeing the Prophet's teachings as incomplete, Survivalism reveals the all-encompassing struggle of the Free Market between individuals for dominance, a struggle unconstrained by morality or beneficence. This struggle demands that competitors hunt and consume those weaker than themselves, to prey upon the unworthy to cultivate their strength and reclaim the energy of the puny. After all, in the Jungle, there is only one law - the strong shall rule the weak, for that is the natural order..."

The faithful focus their worship towards a feminine sun goddess called Fortune, who distributes the blessings of the Free Market in proportion to the Capital a person has accrued so far in their life. However, the boons of Fortune are always given out by way of chance. To cope with the inherent randomness of Fortune’s favor, Decadentists embrace the whims of their goddess and refuse to stay rooted in any single approach to life. Basking in the grace of their fickle mistress, the glory and exaltation which she can bestow are unrivaled, as are the times of hardship and scarcity she may enable. Just the same, the faithful bet on her."
