 modernist_religion_desc:1 "Ultimately deriving its principles from a series of pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] cultural movements, Modernists believe that constant change is necessary for the advancement of humanity: only by continuously defying society's norms may a person and their community be brought to enlightenment. Breaking with tradition and questioning all convention are sacred tasks which may take many different paths, such as novel forms of meditation, the creation of new works of art or even the resistance against tyranny. Modernists hold particular respect for the Old Masters, a pantheon of nearly one hundred sages from [old_brazil|E] whose works, they believe, serve as eternal guides towards incessant change, advancement and reshaping. Most of these faiths survive as minorities within the Empire itself, while others carve out petty realms in the vast expanses of Brazil's interior."

The path towards enlightenment can be unraveled by combining the erection of new structures with meticulous study of the works of the past - in particular, the revolutionary, almost surreal shapes built under the guidance of Lina, the Master Artisan; Niemeyer, the Master Architect; and Lúcio, the Master Planner."

While he is known for imbuing his wisdom and kindness to worthy leaders, he earned this title for the unconditional love he gives to all of his followers. His children today are called to fulfill his vision of Old Brazil, either by ruling magnaminously or supporting those worthy to rule unconditionally."

Followers constantly seek inspiration and meaning from their sacred book "Macunaíma", which recounts the fantastical odyssey of a flawed hero across [old_brazil|E], and whose enigmatic verses have baffled translators and theologians for centuries. While some scholars assert that the imperfect protagonist symbolizes Brazil itself, others delve deeper, believing that profound secrets of transcendence lie concealed within the cryptic layers of this ancient narrative."

 constructivist_adherent_plural:0 "Constructivists"
 constructivist_desc:0 "An outlier amongst Modernist traditions, Universal Constructivism originated in Uruguay, shaped primarily by the visionary teachings of the Master Torres García. Constructivists believe that the universe is neither random nor chaotic, but instead governed by the Aesthetic Order, a transcendental framework of balance, rhythm and proportion that shapes and sustains the material world. According to them, creation is a sacred act: the alignment of symbols, icons and forms brings the world in harmony with this hidden geometry — thus, each gesture of creativity, each composition of shape and line, becomes in itself a devotional practice, a ritual of revelation that draws reality closer to the sacred pattern underlying all things. Every ritual symbol represents both a rejection of the [Concept('naturalism_constructivist','Natural Dogma')|E] and a step towards revealing the Universal Truth concealed beneath the surface of the visible world. In their worldview, the Old Masters are revered as vessels of the Aesthetic Order, distilling the wisdom of ancient American civilizations to forge a spiritual unity that transcends nations, cultures, and epochs."
