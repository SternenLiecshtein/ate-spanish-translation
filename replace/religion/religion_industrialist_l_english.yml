 industrialist_religion_desc:1 "In the Industrialist cosmology, there are many [natural_forces|E] in the world, though the force of [industry|E] is unique in that it can be forged by the actions of humanity into a powerful divine being. When humanity and Industry worked together, miraculous feats were accomplished. This culminated during the [gilded_age|E], a utopian period of universal prosperity and accomplishment. But when humanity grew lax in its devotion, Industry was weakened and could no longer sustain the society mankind had created. The [Concept('the_event_ate','Great Rusting')|E] ruined that once great civilization and brought an end to the Gilded Age. Now, the faithful seek to restore Industry to godhood and usher in a new Gilded Age."

Instead the Sustainablists revere the positive and helpful Forces of nature, such as Dignity, Life, and Community, as their refinement only destroys negative aspects of reality, while Industry itself is almost completely ignored. This process of elevating the other Forces involves joy and celebration, something the faithful view as a source of pride and symbol of their humanity."

Greatly influenced by their Jewish neighbors, this Union is dedicated to the Maker alone, denying the divinity of the Titans altogether. Additionally, this Union is focused on the idea of "reforging the world," an effort to recreate the world of the Gilded Age.
