 #Common Christian Localization
 #christianity_religion: "Christianity"
 #christianity_religion_adj: "Christian"
 #christianity_religion_adherent: "Christian"
 #christianity_religion_adherent_plural: "Christians"
 #christianity_religion_desc: "Christianity has been fundamentally altered by the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E], splintering into innumerable new sects which sometimes diverge far from traditional orthodoxy. However, they are united in their belief that Jesus Christ was the Messiah, the only begotten son of God who died for mankind's sins on the cross. Christian sects believe that, if one accepts Jesus as their savior and repents for their sins, they can join him in Heaven."
 protestant_religion: "Protestantism"
 protestant_religion_adj: "Protestant"
 protestant_religion_adherent: "Protestant"
 protestant_religion_adherent_plural: "Protestants"
 protestant_religion_desc: "Protestantism has its origins in the rejection of Catholic authority, seeking a more personal relationship with God and finding truth in the Bible alone and salvation through faith - a sentiment only exacerbated by the chaos of the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E]. Now, the Protestant denominations of the old Americas forge new paths away from the scattered remnants of ecumenism."

 evangelical: "Evangelicalism"
 evangelical_adj: "Evangelical"
 evangelical_adherent: "Evangelical"
 evangelical_adherent_plural: "Evangelicals"
 evangelical_desc: "The Evangelical Church is the main claimant to the legacy of antediluvian United States Protestantism. In the face of post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E] upheavals, various Protestant churches banded together, putting aside minor theological differences in favor of establishing an Evangelical Convention of Churches presided over by an ecumenical council of bishops. However, some Christians chafe against the doctrines and restrictions imposed by this Convention..."

 charismaticism: "Neo-Charismaticism"
 charismaticism_adj: "Neo-Charismatic"
 charismaticism_adherent: "Neo-Charismatic"
 charismaticism_adherent_plural: "Neo-Charismatics"
 charismaticism_desc: "Neo-Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief that 'charismata', the gifts of the Holy Spirit, are still available to all believers simply through baptism and faith. Believing themselves to carry the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit beyond traditional Charismatics and Pentecostals, Neo-Charismatics believe in the availability of gifts including the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered extraordinary. However, they also desire a structural renewal where apostles and prophets will lead the church to the Kingdom of God. This radical push for an Apostolic Renewal against the hierarchy of the Evangelical Convention has lead the Convention to declare these beliefs heretical, but the Neo-Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Commonwealth."

 global_throne: "Church of the Global Throne"
 global_throne_adj: "Global Throne"
 global_throne_adherent: "Tronista"
 global_throne_adherent_plural: "Tronistas"
 global_throne_desc: "Claiming to be a continuation of the National Evangelical Assembly, the 'Igreja do Trono Global' - the Church of the Global Throne - ultimately traces its origins to several antediluvian third-wave, charismatic and neopentecostal denominations from [old_brazil|E]. Apart from following common evangelical practices, like speaking in tongues or healing by prayer, the Church also adheres to more spectacular customs, such as a heavy emphasis on extraordinary spiritual encounters or the exorcising of demons through deliverance ministries. It claims to be both the one, True Church and the literal Kingdom of God. Embracing the belief that the expansion of its flock and territory will hasten the return of Jesus, Trono Global envisions a future where the world is wholly under its divine rule, awaiting the moment when Christ reclaims His Throne on Earth."

 anglican: "Anglicanism"
 anglican_adj: "Anglican"
 anglican_adherent: "Anglican"
 anglican_adherent_plural: "Anglicans"
 anglican_desc: "Anglicanism describes itself as being a 'via media', or middle way, between Protestantism and the Catholic Church. After the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E], the Anglican Church in the Caribbean refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the American South, instead asserting itself as a separate faith unto itself. It soon became the dominant faith in much of the Anglophone Caribbean, as its tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices allowed it to serve as a unifying force for Christians in the area. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of the West Indies."

 anabaptist: "Old Order"
 anabaptist_adj: "Old Order"
 anabaptist_adherent: "Anabaptist"
 anabaptist_adherent_plural: "Anabaptists"
 anabaptist_desc: "The Old Order are a collection of groups of Conservative Amish, Mennonites, and Brethren, focused on separation from the outside or 'English' world, a principle of nonviolence, and plain living. These tenets make life after the apocalypse difficult and often quite short. Due to the religious violence and general chaos inherent to the post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E] social order, the Old Order has abandoned its former practice of absolute pacifism, but members still strive to avoid violent conflict whenever possible. Using violence in any context - even self-defense - is highly discouraged."

 mennonite: "Mennonite Church"
 mennonite_adj: "Mennonite"
 mennonite_adherent: "Mennonite"
 mennonite_adherent_plural: "Mennonites"
 mennonite_desc: "One of the largest and oldest of the Anabaptist Protestants, the Mennonite Church traces itself to the teachings of Menno Simons, one of the Radical Reformers in contrast to Calvin or Luther. Aiming to restore the old church of Christianity from the time of its foundation, Mennonites emphasize their service to Christ and the renunciation of the sword and oath. While historically Mennonite communities were divided along degrees of participation with the pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] world, those separations were set aside as their policies of religious tolerance and social cohesion allowed them to unite isolated communities left vulnerable by the collapse."
 
 moravian: "Moravian Synod"
 moravian_adj: "Moravian"
 moravian_adherent: "Moravian"
 moravian_adherent_plural: "Moravians"
 moravian_desc: "Moravianism's roots lie in ancient Christian conflict. Moravians were originally a small branch of Protestantism that emphasized community, unity, and simple living; after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E], many Miskitos saw the differences between religions as institutional rather than theological. This mindset sustained a spirit of unity among the Miskito, which continues to this day. United by a synod, Catholic, Protestant and Traditional beliefs came together to bring peace to the region. Believers experience divinity through dreams as well as through spirited discourses on the nature of good, evil, and the human spirit. Adherents, who call themselves brothers and sisters, are united in celebrations called Love Feasts held in honor of the Victorious Lamb."

 nonconformism: "Non-Conformism"
 nonconformism_adj: "Non-Conformist"
 nonconformism_adherent: "Non-Conformist"
 nonconformism_adherent_plural: "Non-Conformists"
 nonconformism_desc: "Non-Conformists are the modern descendants of a wide variety of different Protestant branches and churches who broke away from the Evangelical Convention of South America after the Neo-Pentecostalists attained dominance and imposed restrive controls on the other member churches. Non-Conformists remain the broadest and most pluralistic convention of Protestants on the continent, existing outside the reach of the Brazilian Empire. Their political core is centered mainly on Y Wladfa."

 assembleiano: "Assemblies of Christ"
 assembleiano_adj: "Assembleiano"
 assembleiano_adherent: "Assembleiano"
 assembleiano_adherent_plural: "Assembleianos"
 assembleiano_desc: "The National Evangelical Assembly was the first major attempt to unify all remaining third-wave Protestant movements in Brazil, such as the Christian Congregation, the Assemblies of God and the Baptist fellowships. The initiative was short-lived, however: during the months of Doctrinarian Debates, the fundamentalist neopentecostal sects assumed control over all key posts of the Assembly and expelled those mainstream denominations which refused to submit to their theology. Shortly after, these rejected groups banded together into the new Assemblies of Christ, which later expanded into other parts of Latin America. While individual churches are nominally independent, they all share a number of core doctrines, like Continuationism - that is, the belief that the gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues, miraculous healings, blessings and prophetic proclamations, are still available to all those who believe in Jesus Christ as their savior."
 
 retete: "Reteté Communities"
 retete_adj: "Reteté"
 retete_adherent: "Crente-do-Reteté"
 retete_adherent_plural: "Crentes-do-Reteté"
 retete_desc: "The eclectic nature of Brazilian spirituality allowed for the development of syncretic traditions even within the normally strict doctrine of Pentecostal Christianity. Reteté cults often take place in small house churches or in open-air clearings and incorporate thinly-disguised elements from Afro-Brazilian religions, such as heavy drumming, dancing and spiritual trances - which, they claim, are not manifestations of the Orishas, but signs of the presence of the Holy Spirit itself. The informal nature of their communities, often lacking any traditional hierarchy, and the assimilation of 'heathen' customs, however, leads to Reteté Christianity being seen with contempt, scorn, or even outright hostility by the traditional Protestant churches."

 templarios_desc: "Rooted in eschatological neopentecostal traditions, the fundamentalist Born-Again Templars of Christ, or Templários, believe that the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E] marked the beginning of Satan's dominion over the world. However, just as Jesus announced 'I did not come to bring peace but a sword', Templários prepare for battle - both spiritual and literal - against the forces of evil. For the Templários, expanding the dominion of Christian law is paramount, and doing so through militant action it is the only way to completely liberate mankind from demonic control. Their prophecies tell of an apocalyptical Final War between the armies of good and the forces of Satan himself, whose defeat will herald the beginning of the utopian Kingdom of God. However, Jesus himself will only sit on His earthly throne once the faithful construct the new biblical Temple of Solomon upon the New World."

Amid the post-[Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] world, the faith held to life in tight-knit ethnic enclaves, steadfast in its commitment to tolerance, charity and social justice. The Kirchenbund - literally, the Federation of Churches - believes in the sanctity of the individual’s relationship with God and upholds the doctrine of salvation by the Lord's grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ. To ensure its survival, the church adopted a policy of armed vigilance: it entrusted its missionary and outreach efforts to the Society of Rotermund, a chivalric order dedicated to defending the faithful, ensuring that its message of peace remains resilient against the chaos of the world."

These popular preachers, claiming to have received visions of God and Christ, lead their followers to live in strict devotion and holiness. Believers are taught that the Scriptures command them to renounce the temptations of the world and live in absolute purity, rejecting the indulgences of money, lust, and pleasure. Followers of Muckerism often form isolated communities, dedicated to prayer and ascetic practices - both out of fear from surrounding faiths that condemn their strict piety, as well as to ensure their protection from the moral decay of the outside world. And they will stop at nothing, silencing any threat with unflinching resolve, to preserve their beliefs and keep external influences at bay."

 united_church_desc: "Originally one of the many offshoots of Protestant Christianity in Toronto, the United Church differs from its fellows by its belief that the Holy Spirit acts through all faiths, and that God’s will therefore is best understood through dialogue with other creeds. Through inter-faith services, adherents invite members of other faiths into their holy spaces to perform their own rituals, so as to open new pathways to the divine. The Church retains many elements of traditional Protestant Christianity, believing that the Bible is God’s most direct revelation to humankind, and that Communion is a holy act."

Adopting the name of an ancient act that once guaranteed the right of free worship to all Christians, Calvertans believe in a more personal faith, divorced from the trappings of secular power. Wandering Calvertan preachers hold no possessions of their own except for the clothes on their back and the Bible from which they preach, subsisting entirely on the hospitality and charity of strangers."

 congregationism_desc: "Congregationalists are firmly against any kind of church hierarchy, believing that churches should be entirely independent from each other and should be led only by their local communities. They also firmly believe in the merging of church and state -  laws should conform to Christian morals and should not interfere with the word of God or the teachings of the Bible. As such, they are both moralistic and legalistic, believing that each individual has a responsibility to uphold the principles set down by Moses. Their declaration of faith, adopted by nearly all Congregationalist churches, holds the Evangelical Council to be the Antichrist."

 restorationism_adherent: "Restorationist"
 restorationism_adherent_plural: "Restorationists"
 restorationism_desc: "In the ancient days of the Second Great Awakening, the two legendary ministers Stone and Campbell were said to have restored the Original Gospel of ancient Christianity. They eschewed all authority or polity beyond that of the local church, all trappings of denominational power, and even all instruments of faith in a fervent pursuit of what they believed to be the authentic, pure, and unadultured Christianity of the Apostles. To this day, those who cling to their teachings are still distrustrful of any institutions of faith and repudiate the instruments and iconography common to other Christian churches."

They demand a strict primacy of church over state in a way often compared to a shepherd leading his flock, including the destruction of heresy and heathenry, the 'wolves' of spirituality, regardless of whether it is within the heart of the poorest peasant or the richest king. Conversely, they also demand the church only focus on the spiritual, believing that having them deal with the particulars of governance will encourage lenience when dealing with the politically powerful."

Emphasizing faith alone and love for God, but within a very clear and traditional hierarchy, the Restorationist Synods created a new denomination out of the various Christian sects of the Midwest. Over time, this faith intertwined itself with the Papacy in St. Louis, the rightful heirs to St. Peter, now cleansed of its indulgent history. While this harmed their relationship with independent Protestant churches, it has allowed the schism of the Reformation to begin to heal.

These congregations solve disputes and dilemmas through conference rather than relying on the decision of a single religious authority.

Originally a divergent movement of the Catholic church preaching extreme poverty and rejecting the authority of the priesthood, they willingly joined with the Protestant churches and officially adopted Calvinist theology. Having faced severe persecution in their ancient homeland of Italy, the Waldensians immigrated to Uruguay and the Platine basin in order to practice their faith freely. Despite the turmoils of the merger and migration, the Waldensian Evangelical Church continues its original mission of voluntary poverty, serving the downtrodden and dispossessed of their local communities as part of their calling."

While many chose to turn the other cheek and remain set in their ways, others concluded that the only way to defend themselves was to take up the sword. This new 'Sword-Minded' movement holds that the sinful world can no longer be shunned, it must be saved and redeemed. Self-defense is taught to adherents, and warfare is permitted so long as it takes place for righteous reasons. Missionary work is also encouraged, with the movement believing that all mankind must be a part of God’s flock before an age of peace can begin. Tolerating no deviation from God’s words, they often decry other Christians as having fallen to sin due to perceived lapses in morality or commitment to the truth of the Bible."

This light can be discovered both on an individual and community level, with religious and social decisions being made by holding meetings in which the attendees collectively determine what path God desires them to take. Lacking a centralized hierarchy, Quaker communities can differ vastly on some doctrines such as baptism, icons, or even theism, but some common beliefs include pacifism, simple living, and a mission to promote social reform and community harmony."

 shango_baptist_desc: "The islands of the eastern Caribbean have been home to a multitude of religious traditions since before the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E]. Two faiths in Trinidad were more interlinked than most; the Shangoists, an Afro-Diasporic tradition similar to Santeria, and the Spiritual Baptists, a Protestant church descended from Gullah who came to the island after a long-ago war. The 'Shango Baptist Church' is a term recognizing the interlinked nature of these two traditions, juxtaposed as they are under one label. Broadly speaking, both sects of the Shango Baptists believe in a Holy Trinity of three distinct persons who are often co-identified with Yoruba divinities like Olorun and who have their own wills. Orishas and the spirits of saints act as intermediaries to the Trinity (as well as the Holy Spirit himself, who can possess worshippers). Unusually, the use of Catholic-style saint icons is common in worship rituals as well."

 cavalier_adherent_plural: "Cavaliers"
 cavalier_desc: "Once the religion of the pre-[Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E] American nobility, the Cavalier Church has had its influence massively reduced over the centuries since that great calamity. Still nostalgic for this magnificent past, Cavaliers idealize the lost standards of chivalry and piousness that were once upheld by the elites of society. These bonds of honor and law, based on the teachings of Jesus, had given those of lower birth the freedom to worship God and live decently underneath the protection of their rulers. The church’s staunch adherence to tradition and usage of an ancient liturgical book, the Book of Common Prayer, make it a strange anachronism in the modern day. Yet, this gives the faithful all the more motivation to keep their glorious history from ever being forgotten."

 new_birth_revival_desc: "Much like the lowly sinner finding Jesus, some Protestants found the need to revitalize the faith after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Deluge')|E]. Utilizing tent revivals and camp meetings as their primary structures, Revivalists rely on blessed individuals to periodically lead these events and organize the faithful towards various divine purposes. During these seasons of energy, converts are often won over via miraculous healing and passionate gospel music. However, after the initial zeal fades, the Revivalists set themselves apart from many religions by viewing new birth via baptism as forever granting someone salvation, regardless of later backsliding."

As only one church can be worthy of God's presence, Colossalist pastor-kings strive to demonstrate they alone are worthy of such an honor."

While each individual community can hold wildly different views from one another, every Evangelista church offers the same broad message: a direct, personal relationship with God, free of divine or temporal intermediaries, which manifests in His charismatic gifts. These doctrines are seen as heretical and subversive by the Catholic mainstream and therefore frequently suppressed. As a result, Evangelistas often operate in secret, keeping the Reformation's ideals strong in the face of adversity."

Further, belief in Charismata and an extreme emphasis on function over form in their architecture set the Federation apart from other denominations."

Once this network outnumbers the unsaved, God will be able to end the world as it exists and establish the prosperous world to come. Until that hour, the faithful create holy objects by which they can receive the blessings of Christ and transmit their own prayer. These spiritual energies, alongside substantial temporal donations, are transferred to its leader, the Televangelist, who uses these resources to spread the Gospel. In turn, the laity will surely see their own spiritual and temporal success increase, spoken into being via the Word of Faith as part of their offered seeds and positive visualization."
