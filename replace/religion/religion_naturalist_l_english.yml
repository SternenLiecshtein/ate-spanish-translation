This veneration of beach recreation has led to a particular indulgence in the sport of surfing, which is valued among the Gnarlists not only for its connection to the ocean, but for the skill and athleticism it fosters. Beyond its physical and spiritual merits, the sea also gives them the resources and nourishment to survive through fishing and aquaculture.
