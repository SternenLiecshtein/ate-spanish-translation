Rather, the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] was made manifest by the actions of the Old Gods, vast forces with various names that move with unknowable and uncaring purpose. The Occultists cope with the machinations of these incomprehensible beings in differing ways, but none among them deny that humanity lives underneath enormously powerful entities which are incapable of mustering any feeling towards something as tiny as mankind. The only path to survival in a world such as this is to first understand just how insignificant people are within it."

They stand as guardians, shrouded in the cold, dark aura that echoes the desolate whispers of a forsaken enlightenment. The Deep Ones, beckoned by the recklessness of the Old World’s so-called Great Awakening, destroyed the Old World that forsook the ancient safeguards, leaving the pitiful few who tended to the Lights to seek refuge on these shores. The faithful's aversion to outsiders and their ideas serves as a crucial linchpin in maintaining the delicate balance of the New World, for any lapse of vigilance may cause the Lights to falter, and the protective barrier that wards the Deep Ones will collapse to usher in an era of intractable madness, unending famine, and unfathomable terror that shall consume the New World."

 gothic_desc:0 "In the heart of ancient New England woods, where shadows dance like moonlit specters, Gothic Occultery unfolds in the hidden clearings and burnt-out hearths where winds whisper secrets that only the gifted and chosen can fully comprehend. The faithful find solace in the haunted echoes of elder tales, where the lines between good and evil become invisible in the darkness. Madness, a mantle worn by the outside world, finds no place here; for the faithful, clarity and protection is found through communion with the strange forces that govern the universe. The [ageless_stranger|E], the enigmatic link between mortals and the Old Ones, is the conduit through which the influence of these powers are felt and utilized. Though... always at a price."

This mission is to preserve and defend humanity’s wisdom from the grasp of Madness, the insanity which threatens to consume the universe unless resisted. The Arcanists believe that the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E] was caused by a failure of humanity to safeguard its secrets and powers from Madness, and to prevent this from ever happening again, they carefully gather antediluvian knowledge and magic while showing unwavering fealty to the Grand Architect and the once living masons who have since been blessed and elevated to assist in the Architect’s grand designs."
