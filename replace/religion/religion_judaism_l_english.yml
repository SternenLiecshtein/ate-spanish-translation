Although there is a great deal of diversity in Haredi religious practice, they are united in their anticipation of Moshiach, or the Jewish Messiah. Haredim believe that Moshiach's arrival will be accompanied by the return of the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael and the ushering in of peace on earth. In the meantime, Haredim fastidiously study and adhere to Halakha, or Jewish religious law, believing that this will facilitate Moshiach's imminent arrival. Haredim are notable for their tendency to limit participation with the culture of outsiders, although they do not go out of their way to antagonize non-Jews or otherwise interfere with their lives."

Reform Jews believe that Halakha, or Jewish religious law, is non-binding, allowing every Jew to autonomously interpret and practice Judaism as they see fit. As such, the vast majority of Reform Jews openly ignore halakhic rules regarding gender roles and sexual norms; women are regularly ordained as rabbis and same-sex weddings are routinely conducted. Reform Jews do not universally believe in the imminent arrival of Moshiach, and are instead devoted to the principle of Tikkun Olam, or repair of the world. This principle holds that each Reform Jew must work to restore the pre-Event world through collective effort and force of will, with special attention paid to eliminating social inequality."

The notion of a centuries-dead man being Moshiach appears to contradict most Jewish teachings on the subject, but Meshichists reconcile this by claiming that the Rebbe is still "alive" in a metaphorical and spiritual sense and that he will one day complete his duties and usher in an age of peace on Earth. Meshichists place a great deal of importance on the more mystical and esoteric aspects of Jewish religious practice, but this is coupled with a fastidious study of Halakha that is typical of traditional Judaism."

Amazonian Jews believe that having a spiritual connection with God's creation - in particular, with the great rainforest that they have called home for centuries - is just as important as having an intellectual understanding of God's laws. Amazonian Jews also make no effort to isolate themselves from non-Jewish society, as the harsh environment of the Amazon would make any such effort impractical at best.

Today, only the memories of the old empires remain, and the descendants of the coerced Jews - the Anussim - are free to once again practice Judaism openly. They believe that most of the inhabitants of the Americas are also descendants of Jews, although many have forgotten their heritage, and as such encourage the lost members of their tribe to return to the ancient faith."

These Renewal Jews focus foremost on the shared wisdom which all religious traditions can provide, - though they are fiercely defensive of their unique identity.. Primarily concerned with mysticism, especially Kabbalah, the faith also utilizes psychedelics to enhance their connection with the divine. This sharing of traditionally secretive rituals makes them controversial to some other Jewish faiths."

These "B'nai Beis" embrace their long lineage of pastoralism as one of their key strengths. Turning inwards, the faith relies on the bonds of their villages, the constant willingness to lend a hand or defend their neighbors in need. However, this introversion is not unfriendliness or fear of the outside world. The faithful refuse to bend to any outside oppression, while always remembering that the Talmud teaches that “greater is hospitality than receiving the Divine Presence,” an unflinching kindness in a hostile land."

However, the requirements for a healthy Jewish civilization have changed drastically since the Event. The faithful see it as the duty of humanity to live in harmony with the all-encompassing God which constitutes the natural world. Often conducting worship outdoors, Reconstructionist society focuses on creating a form of living that appreciates the world's inherent beauty and disrupts its normal functions as little as possible. Reconstructionism espouses this model as the most viable method of social organization, and the best way for the Jews of the Americas to adapt their civilization to the demands of the modern day without losing sight of their existing traditions."
