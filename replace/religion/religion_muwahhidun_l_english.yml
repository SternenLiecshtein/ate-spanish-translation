 druze_desc:0 "The Druze began as the followers of the Preacher ad-Darazi, whose beliefs brought them into conflict with surrounding Muslims. Through hundreds of years of oppression, the Druze eventually fled to the New World to establish new lives. Druze doctrines are guarded carefully, and oftentimes adherents themselves know little about their faith beyond their Seven Duties, Muwahhidun practices and that reincarnation awaits them after death. Those that are permitted to know the doctrines and read from their holy books are known as the Uqqal, while the average Druze is called a Juhhal."
