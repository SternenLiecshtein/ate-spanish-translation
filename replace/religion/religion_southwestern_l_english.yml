 hozhooji_desc:0 "The Diné believe in a cycle of three previous worlds through which the ancestors traveled before arriving here in the fourth world. This creation narrative forms the basis of their ritual complex, in which stories and narratives are reenacted by masked dancers and Hataałii for a variety of reasons ranging from healing to coming of age to dispelling evil. The songs are divided into two: the Hózhóójí - the blessing way - used for healing and positive acts and the Anaʼí Ndáá - the enemy way - used to curse and empower for war. Furthermore, the Diné hold closely to a variety of taboos and shun the ’ánt’įįhnii, practitioners of dark magic and wielders of death."

Adherents believe that Onóruame, father of the Rarámuri, is the Sun himself, who is married to Iyéruame, the mother of humankind, the Moon. These figures are known to outsiders as Jesus Christ and Mary respectively. The faithful make long distance journeys on foot to collect peyote to utilize for various important religious and medicinal purposes. In addition to the two main gods, lesser spirits are often asked for blessings such as rain, health, or successful hunts, usually in the form of celebrations dedicated to a particular spirit. During these festivals, rivalries can be resolved using ritual combat, after which the two feuding parties reconcile. Due to their lifestyle, the Rarámuri have a reputation as tough and enduring people."

It is often symbolized in art as a maze, the journey of life which all believers go through until they reunite with their creator. It also symbolizes the caves I’itoi is said to reside within under Waw Kiwulik, the mountain from whence the O’odham emerged when the world was remade, where he watches over his people to this day. Christian elements have merged with the ancient practices over time, with the Himdag syncretized with the Ten Commandments and Padre Kino likened to Moses."
