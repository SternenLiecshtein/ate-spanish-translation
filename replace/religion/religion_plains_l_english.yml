 sun_dance_desc:0 "The Sun Dance is the central ritual of the Plains religious complex, a yearly event where all ancestors and spirits are believed to participate alongside the living. The ceremony opens with the dreams and visions of the presiding medicine people, continuing in earnest with ritual piercing and suspension followed by a constant dance for the next four days. Food and water are abstained from by the dancers in a feat of strength and endurance, reinforcing tribal ethics of selflessness, bravery, and tenacity. The acts of self-mortification and dancing empower the whole tribe, as the dancers give of themselves to appease the spirits and thank their creator. Additionally, bison skin and bones are used on the central pole to honor the bison and the creator, who may bestow fortune or blessings upon the tribe."
