He planted the first seeds in the fertile primordial soils of the earth in the form of several powerful Queens, one for each kind of plant and animal, and granted them the laws by which they would grow and diversify. Since then, the laws have demanded the bloodlines of the Lineage Queens engage in fierce competition, absorbing the genetic mana they need to prosper from other living beings who walk the earth, including ones of your own kind. Those individuals who obtain the most of this genetic mana become Naturally Selected, and their essence shall be infused into them and all of their children."

This Eden was perfect, and it had only one law: mankind must not harm the other creatures of the Garden unless absolutely necessary. However, people began to leave the Garden to build cruel hierarchies. The most terrible of these oppressors was Babylon, which was the first to disobey. It even subverted the children of the Gardener's beloved wife, Stella Maris, using her life-giving waters to wash away the homes of innocents who refused to renounce Eden for Babylon's "civilization". The Gardener ended its tyranny by sending His angel, Chicxulub, to cast down Babylon and free the people once more. At present, Edenists live simple lives, respecting the creatures of Eden and honoring the waters which the Gardener and Stella Maris gave unto them."
