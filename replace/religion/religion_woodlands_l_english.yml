The various peoples of this region developed various different belief systems in the millennia that they have lived on the continent. Some common threads include the centrality of medicine societies, as well as the confederation model of social organization; in the time since colonization and the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], many of the cultural groups of the Eastern Woodlands still maintain their storied traditional ways."

 #haudenosaunee_religion_desc:0 "The Haudenosaunee people originated as a confederation formed through the actions of Hiawatha, Skennenrahawi, and Jigonhsasee; a leader, seer, and female leader respectively. Their work led to the creation of the 'Great Law of Peace' by Skennenrahawi, the great peacemaker and seer. These laws formed the basis of Haudenosaunee society for hundreds of years. Upon encountering Europeans, divisions within this society formed between those who integrated with the Europeans and adopted Christianity, the traditionalists, and those who adapted their faith and religion to counter European influence."

Twice a year, the Gai'wiio is publicly proclaimed in an elaborate ceremony resembling Christian revival meetings."

While he had many different names, the Haudenosaunee believe that the Great Spirit, who is the chief of a pantheon of deity figures, was born with an evil twin, who killed their mother during his birth. Various other spirits inhabit the natural world and are responsible for everything from good harvests to natural disasters. The Great Law of Peace, established by the Great Peacemaker and his spokesman Hiawatha, codified a social constitution for the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, including rites, rituals, and ceremony. This includes practices of housing spirits inside masks, in order to protect households from evil."

Ancestral legends are retold in a year-long cycle of ceremonies marking different phases of the harvest.
