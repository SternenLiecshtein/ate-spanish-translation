 #Samaj Hindu
 samaj_hinduism:0 "Samaji"
 samaj_hinduism_adj:0 "Samaj"
 samaj_hinduism_adherent:0 "Samaj Hindu"
 samaj_hinduism_adherent_plural:0 "Samaj Hindus"
 samaj_hinduism_desc:0 "Samaji is a reformist strain of Hinduism, stressing adherence to the Vedas, monotheism, and aniconism. They view the Vedas as an authoritative text given directly by God to the people and it is only worshiped in the form of a sacrificial flame. The "Gods" of the Vedas are seen not as deities, but as names for the single God, "Aum" the formless creator of the universe whose name contains all knowledge within its single syllable."

 hinduism_religion_desc:0 "Hinduism is a broad grouping of a number of diverse faiths originating in India which hold the four vedas as their foundational text. These faiths are diverse and range from focusing on a single deity exclusively to having no core priesthood or central deity. These faiths were brought to the Americas by immigrants who continued their own practices and converted local peoples as well. Many adapted to the new cultural and geographical landscapes by modifying practices to include others and establish themselves within a local context."

Sanatanism has abandoned the caste system of India in favour of a more flat structure that continues to venerate the old deities as well as new ones; as the sacred traditions and geographies of the ancient homeland are blended with the new."

 hare_krishna_desc:0 "The Hare Krishna Society was born out of the teachings of the Great Saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu who taught supreme devotion to the Lord Krishna as the source of the creator Vishnu and all avatars. Human beings are trapped in a state of Maya, illusion, and are unaware of their source in Krishna, thus trapping them in a cycle of reincarnation. Through devotion to Krishna, one seeks union with him and thus absolute bliss and escape from endless rebirth. Adherents practice this devotion to Krishna via gazing, chanting, singing, and dancing, all based around their devotion to Lord Krishna."

While all things are directed by and connected to the cosmic soul, they are weighed down by grains of Karma which cause them to be trapped in unending birth and rebirth. Only by properly harnessing the power of Brahman and the destructive power of [Concept('upnehimacharya','Lord Shiva')|E] by splitting an Atom, may humanity eventually realize the true nature of Brahman and attain Moksha."
