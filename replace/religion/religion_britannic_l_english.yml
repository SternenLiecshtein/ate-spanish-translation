 britannic_religion_desc:1 "The Britannic faiths believe that long ago, all the world was under the hegemony of the Empire, a glorious nation bathed in eternal sunlight and presided over by divine rulers. Unfortunately, the fall of that majestic state came, causing the sun to set for the first time in centuries. The Britannians aim above all else to restore the Empire through devotion to its nigh-forgotten rulers."

 waveruler_desc:0 "Beneath the waves, there is an ancient empire that once spanned the oceans of the globe, Britannia’s Dominion. The Waverulers carry forth the torch of its legacy by worshiping its monarch, the eternal Queen of the Sea, Britannia. Long ago, this great watery Dominion was nearly destroyed when the creeping cold of Antarctica attempted to freeze the seas. Fortunately, by calling forth Her champion, the Iron Angel, the frigid invasion was repulsed and mankind was spared, but at the cost of Britannia's oceanic empire. Now Britannia is a shadow of Herself, only able to protect and give Her bounties to the steadfast peoples of the Falklands. To honor their goddess, the faithful continue to respect Her marine Dominion and pray for the day which Britannia may swell forth to once again rule over all seas of the world to bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Until then, the faithful wait with stalwart pride in their goddess."
