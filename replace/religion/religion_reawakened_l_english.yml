So named for the truths revealed to their founders, the Reawakened realize that the Event was but one of many confirmations that the old churches had lost their ways and that Christianity needed to be set back upon the righteous path as the world inched ever closer to Armageddon - though what exactly that righteous path is can vary wildly between denominations."

 christian_science_desc:0 "When Mary Baker Eddy was near death, she read from her Bible an account of Jesus’ healings, and was herself healed. In this moment, she realized the truth - that injury and illness were no match for the all-power and all-love of God, and that sin and error had no place in God’s creation. The practices she had rediscovered were codified in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, and the Christian Scientist movement was born. Believing that material reality itself is an illusion born of error and that humanity is a spiritual reflection of God, Christian Scientists seek to heal themselves of the errors they believe result in disease and injury, and continued misguided belief in material existence in order to achieve atonement with God."

However, Babylon invaded and corrupted the hearts of the Builders, who turned from God’s path and destroyed one another’s works. Intending to restart God’s plan which was delayed by the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], the Society for a New Jerusalem models itself, in a literal and figurative sense, after the Old World, emulating their governance and their architecture in a bid to restore the Kingdom and usher in the world to come."

They regard themselves as the new chosen people of God, residing in the land given to them by the Almighty in the West like Israel was given to Moses' people in the East. Likewise, Ezequiel is considered the Christ of the West, the reincarnation of the Christ of the East, Jesus of the New Testament. The Inca built Machu Picchu and their kingdom with the aid of God in ther Holy Land of the East, but the people strayed from God's commandments and became separated from Him. The New Universal Pact is a restoration of the covenant God made with His people - Israelites therefore keep to all of the laws described in Leviticus, wearing only clothes described in the Bible and growing their hair and beards long. They believe that God will soon come to judge mankind, but He will spare the people of privileged Peru and grant heaven on earth to those who remain steadfast in their faith."

The faithful also acknowledge the existence of spirits, especially those of deceased ancestors, who may do both good and evil at the beckoning of 'obeah' holy men and women. These entities sit beneath God the Father in a hierarchy of celestial and terrestrial spirits, alongside Mother Earth and various Hindu deities, a theological order similar to other Kongo-influenced cosmologies such as Kumina or Palo."

The New Church, they claim, is the restored church of Jesus Christ, who was the incarnate Jehovah. Specifically, they believe that Jesus progressed towards Jehovah during his life by gradually making his human body one with divinity, putting it as "the Lord's Human is Divine". Love and charity, coupled with acknowledgment of the Lord, provide the pathway to salvation and union with Jesus. Indeed, some of the most famous American folk heroes are claimed as believers by the Swedenborgians; however, they are often treated harshly by other Christians for their occultic practices and their rejection of the Trinity as three persons in one."

 jesuist_desc:0 "The Jesuist Movement seeks to re-establish the original religious movement of Jesus of Nazareth as they understand it. Believing that Jesus was a wise and admirable spiritual leader, the faith seeks to distance itself from other Christians who see him as part of the supernatural Godhead. Instead, they use their own scripture, which contains Jesus’ words and teachings, but no miracles. This peculiar theology wins them few friends among the rest of Christianity and the faithful in turn see the Nicene and Trinitarian traditions as coming from a corrupted account of Jesus devised by Paul, who they reject as a false prophet. While predominantly deistic, the movement has consistent internal debates over the nature of Jesus and his message; it is also averse to iconographic worship, instead preferring austere ceremonies. The faithful maintain humility and restraint, in order to live as Jesus did."

The goal of life is to achieve spiritual evolution along the Seven Worlds Within God, until eventually reuniting with God as the Emanation of the Absolute. Rosicrucians believe this can be achieved through spiritual awakening, which is the result of attaining mystical knowledge and training. Today the sect as a whole exists at the outskirts of Christianity in general, with some various outposts of fellowships remaining in some storied lodges across the Americas."

In doing so, Miktlantekuhtli, the Angel of Death and King of Miktlan, replaced the Holy Spirit within the Trinity, and thus a new covenant with mankind was undertaken. The Paktokej believe that all those that die, regardless of faith, go to Chiknautopan and witness God, so for the faithful, killing is a viable alternative to proselytizing. For now is the age of rebirth, the old ways must end, willing or not, so that the Third Covenant may blossom."

Jesus Freaks preach that everyone holds the Holy Free Spirit within them, meaning that all are saved under the Father. Therefore, necessary righteous wisdom is to be found within the messages of all Saintly Gurus who expounded virtues of peace and love, no matter their creed. In addition to the teachings of the Gurus, the Jesus Freaks recognize the great insights those with the Charismatic Gifts are given by God, providing a dynamic understanding of scripture. Above all, the Jesus Freaks seek to live lives full of love and free-spiritedness, allowing them to cultivate a personal relationship with the Messianic Guru."

 christadelphian_desc:0 "Believing in an unorthodox and pacifistic tradition, and that most other Christian sects have forgotten or corrupted the original teachings of Jesus, Christadelphians reject the Trinity, as well as the existence of demons or the immortality of the soul. While these distinctions cause them to be seen as heretics by more mainstream forms of the religion, the agreement between Christadelphianism and most Protestants on biblical primacy and inerrancy have improved relations between the two groups. Believers tend to see their faith as being validated by the Event, which is seen as the physical prelude to the new age that their founders spoke of long ago."
