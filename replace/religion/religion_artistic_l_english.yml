 darian_adherent_plural:0 "Vanguardistas"
 darian_desc:0 "For as long as humanity has existed, it has danced with the forces of [regression_vanguardia|E] and [progress_vanguardia|E], bringing civilization back and forth, between evil and good. Just as the old world went from the dark ages, onward to abundance and knowledge, before being pulled back by the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E], the Vanguards of Progress believe this must continue. Looking to the past, not with reverence, but to find knowledge, the Vanguardia analysis of history reveals that it was not the sword, boot, or whip that touched their souls, letting them accept Progress, but art. In the footsteps of the [great_progressors_vanguardia|E], their names many, Vanguardistas seek mastery over poetry and words in order to defeat the ancient Caudillos, slaves to Regression. Only then can Regression be truly broken, and the fruits of Progress be kept."
