 mormon_religion_adj:0 "Latter Day Saint"
 mormon_religion_adherent:0 "Latter Day Saint"
 mormon_religion_adherent_plural:0 "Latter Day Saints"
 mormon_religion_desc:0 "The Latter Day Saint movement is a Christian tradition unified by their belief that the true church of Christ was lost soon after Christ's death, and restored by angelic revelations to Joseph Smith in old America. Alongside the Bible, they hold to a new set of scriptures called the Book of Mormon, translated by Smith from ancient golden plates, which discuss the history of an ancient Israelite civilization in the Americas, visited by Christ after his death. Different LDS sects hold to a wide variety of doctrines and practices that are contentious within and outside the movement, and which collectively separate the LDS from more traditional Nicene churches."

 mormon_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also known simply as the LDS Church or Mormons, is historically the dominant branch of the LDS movement. The Church's theology centers around the Plan of Salvation, by which they believe Christ set a path to live as part of an eternal family with God after death, through performing good works and sacred ordinances. Largely rooted in the Rocky Mountains, far from the Midwestern communities of Smith's time, the LDS have seen a new era of political independence after the [Concept('the_event_ate','Event')|E]. Drawing on the ancient republican ideals of the Americas, known through law and scripture, the Church has built a new Theodemocracy - the code to which the old LDS strongholds and their nobility are held - to guide the faithful's political ascent."

 woolleyite_adj:0 "Fundamentalist"
 woolleyite_adherent:0 "Fundamentalist"
 woolleyite_adherent_plural:0 "Fundamentalists"
 woolleyite_desc:0 "The LDS Fundamentalist movement refers to a variety of sects that splintered from the mainline LDS Church over a variety of doctrines they believed were being wrongly discarded due to worldly pressures - most notably, polygamy. While largely agreeing on the first three legitimate latter-day prophets - Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and John Taylor - the movement is often fractious, historically composed of many small isolationist communities and loose associations with their own leadership. Isolation and decentralization have often made fundamentalists resilient to persecutions, but also hampered efforts at coordination."

 strangite_desc:0 "The Strangites are an LDS sect who uphold James Strang as the prophetic successor to Joseph (and Hyrum) Smith, believing all prophets must be divinely appointed rather than merely succeeding to an office. As "King" of his church, Strang introduced practices such as animal sacrifice, and defended others like polygamy, bolstered by his addition of the Book of the Law of the Lord and the testament of an ancient king of Voree, Wisconsin to his faith's canon. No prophet was called after Strang, so higher offices of the priesthood are no longer filled - those who remain with the church have abandoned proselytization until a new prophet is called, to resume the work of the last dispensation."

An ancient prophecy holds that the Lamanites "shall blossom as a rose", and they are keen to see its fulfillment."

 ensignite_desc:0 "For the Ensignites, the center of their faith comes from the personal powers of healing and revelation. They believe these priesthood powers to be a universal gift, and are suspicious of those who would claim authority over their use. As such, they eschew formal hierarchies, instead gathering around those who have shown themselves to be in tune with their own personal spiritual gifts, and thus with God - often women with knowledge of healing, and with the help of items imbued with healing powers. Additionally, the Heavenly Mother is held in great esteem by these healers, who claim that her lack of veneration in other LDS traditions is proof of their spiritual failings. The Ensignites also believe that Earth itself is a sacred space - especially mountains, as temples raised up by God Himself - and so often perform services and ordinances outdoors."

 bickertonite_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ - often called the "Bickertonites" after William Bickerton, their reorganizer after Sydney Rigdon and third president - rejects many doctrines held by other LDS churches, believing that Joseph Smith introduced false doctrines as an adult, like polygamy. As such, while they embrace the Book of Mormon, they reject any of Smith's revelations that do not have an independent basis in the Bible and Book of Mormon. They await the "Choice Seer" of the Book of Mormon, who they believe is not Joseph Smith but a Native American prophet. Their interpretation of the ordinances and spiritual gifts in the Bible has also seen them called "Pentecostal Mormons" - speaking in tongues, laying on of hands, feet-washing, and other "charismatic" practices are staples of the Church's practice."

The CoC holds to some of the unique doctrines present throughout the LDS movement, such as continuous revelation, but also holds to a more traditional trinitarian theology. This, combined with a long history of ecumenical outreach, has given the CoC better relations with Nicene Christian sects than most other LDS faiths. The CoC places special emphasis on the promotion of peace and justice, leading them to embrace women in the ministry, alongside promoting worldly peace, and extolling their followers to live in a "Zionic" fashion in their spiritual and worldly pursuits."

 diahmanite_desc: "The Diahmanites, named for the valley in which Adam and Eve lived out their mortal lives, believe that when Eve partook of the Fruit of Knowledge, she did so not in sin or ignorance, but as a deliberate, reasoned step to ensure the Plan of Salvation could come to fruition, and receive revelation on good and evil. The Diahmanites uphold this as the first and greatest example of a universal human duty, to actively seek divine revelation and ensure God’s plan is not frustrated by narrow understandings of the gospel or tradition. They believe God to consist of the Father and Mother, and call this Elohim - and that the Archangel, consisting of Adam and Eve, takes an active role in administering Their kingdom. Spiritual dualities such as these stand alongside a radical liberalization of the family structure, an apparent contrast reconciled by the gradual, collective sealing of the all-encompassing Eternal Family."
